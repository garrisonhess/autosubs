some mornings i wake up crying without knowing why 

thats when everything happens now and again 

whatever that dream was i had i can never remember it 

but but 

the only thing that does last when i wake up 

is a sense of loss 

which lingers for a long time afterwards 

im always searching for something 

or someone 

ive been consumed by this feeling 

ever since that day 

the day a star fell 

it was almost like 

like seeing something out of a dream 

nothing more or less 

than a breathtaking view than a breathtaking view 

ah if only our voices speak at night 

could ever reach the very edge of this world 

and of time 

instead of fading into air and dust 

then what will the words could it ever be 

farthest words from probably 

lets make a promise that will never fade 

lets say it together on the count of three oh 

ah im told that some part of every wish will be heard 

but lately ive lost sight of the truth in those words 

i cant even remember when i gave up believing 

what could have been the reason 

ah the very moment that the rain will stop 

in the place rainbow born and dies 

and where the end of this life lies 

ive always been insisting there was something that ive longing for 

one day well reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented 

well high five love weve yet to discover and give a kiss to time 

the five dimensions keeps on teasing me 

but i will keep on looking at you dear 

lets make a sign for when we say nice to meet you again 

im on my way to you 

chasing after your name 

taki 

taki 

taki 

dont you remember 

my name is 

mitsuha

attention citizens of itomori 

good morning 

this is an official announcement from itomori town hall 

it is in regards to the mayoral election 

the election will be held on the twentieth of next month 

the election committee would like to remind everyone tha 

a comet that comes only once every twelve hundred years 

will finally be headed our way in a month 

the comet will be visible to the naked eye for several days once it approaches the earth 

just make up with him already okay 

thats an adult matter according to jaxas spokesperson theyre preparing for the celestial show of the millennium 

were leaving were leaving 

i cant wait til the festival its gonna be so much fun 

study hard sis 

ah 

mitsuha 

good mornin saya mornin teshi 

mornin come on would you get off already 

what for meanie cause youre heavy 

hey thats rude yknow i gotta say you two make a great couple 

no we dont no we dont 

oh i see you actually bothered to do your hair today 

wait what oh yeah what happened did your grandma exorcise all your demons 

exorcise somethin totally possessed your body 

would you just give it a rest with all this occult nonsense 

mitsuhas gotta be feelin stressed enough as it is right what are you guys talking about 

are you feelin okay 

and above all restoring the towns fiscal health so we can continue our revitalization project 

its only when all these things are achieved that we can create a safe and secure community 

as the incumbent my administration miyamizus gonna get another term anyway 

i hear hes been dullin out the pork just between us 

hey miyamizu mornin 

looks like the mayor and the contractors kid are pretty cozy too 

to improve the quality of life of each and every resident 

mitsuha 

stand up straight when youre walking 

oh hes tough on his family 

well thats the mayor for ya 

awkward sucks to be her 

mitsuha 

in front of everyone 

two light thats the origin of the word twilight 

im sure everyone here knows that word 

its dusk a time when its neither day nor night 

when the border between worlds blur 

and one might encounter something not human 

another older term for it is dusk light 

some people also call it golden hour 

what about magic hour its something my grandma says 

well golden hour and magic hour are technically the same 

but its a term that mostly photographers use 

well she does take a lot of pictures 

okay next 

miyamizu uh yes 

well i can see that you remember your own name today 

uh uh 

well believe it or not you forgot where your own desk and locker were yesterday 

plus you had the worst case of bedhead and you didnt have your ribbon on either 

what no way 

yeah it was like you had amnesia or somethin 

now that you mention it i do feel like ive been havin weird dreams lately 

like a dream about someone elses life 

its all so fuzzy 

wait a sec ive got it 

its memories from a previous life 

or maybe your subconscious linked to the everett interpretation of the multiverse 

keep your full mouth shut 

wait a minute teshi dont tell me you were the one who wrote in my noteboo k 

forget it 

but you really were actin just a little funny yesterday mitsuha 

you been feelin okay 

thats whats weird i feel fine 

maybe its from stress you know youve got that ritual comin up soon dontcha 

ugh dont remind me 

i cant stand this place anymore its too small and town ey 

i wanna graduate already and go to tokyo as soon as i can 

cant say i blame you there really is nothin at all in this town 

theres only one train that stops here every two hours and all the stores close at nine o clock 

no bookstores no dentists 

but two cocktail lounges for whatever reason 

no jobs in town no one date able 

even the days are too short 

you know what 

no what no what 

forget that stuff why dont we go to a cafe 

a cafe really 

where where 

hello kids 

hi there evenin maam 

how is this a cafe like this towns got a cafe 

mitsuha just went straight home 

things have gotta be really rough for her right now shes on center stage and all 

yeah 

hey teshi hm 

what are you gonna do after you graduate high school 

whered that come from you talkin about the future 

mh hm 

i dunno i think ill probably just end up livin in this town yknow same as ever 

i wanna do what youre doin 

its still too soon for you to try yotsuha 

listen to the threads voice 

when you twine it round and round like this feelings will start flowing between you and the thread 

its not like threads talk shes telling you to focus 

etched within our braided cords is a thousand years worth of itomoris history 

listen somethin happened two hundred years ago 

here she goes 

the bathroom of sandal maker mayugoro yamazaki caught on fire and this whole area burned down 

the shrine and old documents were destroyed 

this is known as mayugoros great fire 

they named the fire after him i feel bad for mayugoro 

the meaning behind our festivals was lost because of that 

only the surface was left 

but even if those words are gone those words shouldnt fade 

thats the miyamizu shrines duty our important task 

ugh 

despite all that that son in law of mine 

abandoning the shinto priesthood and leaving this house were bad enough but politics 

oh hes hopeless 

have another mister foreman 

ill be counting on your help again for this election leave it to me 

youll get the votes from the kadoiri and sakagami districts guaranteed 

hows the datin scene it aint easy thats for sure 

smells like corruption in there what are you talkin about 

were gonna need two or three more bottles yes dear 

katsuhiko youre gonna help out at the site this weekend 

well be usin explosives so you better study up grngh 

what was that 

got it 

guess we both cant stand things here 

is that yotsuha shes all grown up 

theyre lookers alright just like their mother 

heya hey 

worlds oldest kind of sake 

but chewin on rice spittin it out and then lettin it ferment naturally it becomes alcohol 

kuchikamizake 

do the gods really appreciate that the way its ma 

yeah of course they do 

hey check it out its miyamizu 

ugh id never do that and in front of everybody embarrassing right 

you should try to cheer up sis 

who cares if a few of the kids from your school saw that 

it must be nice for you not being a teenager 

hey i know you should just sell kuchikamizake and move to tokyo 

i bet you could sell it with all sorts of stuff like photos and making of videos 

oh and then you can call it shrine maidens sake youll make buttloads

well you did kinda make a scene yesterday uh 

did you see all the election posters 

doesnt matter who wins nothinll change cept for who gets the kickback 

shhh somebodys daddys dependent on it 

theyre talking about me right 

uh 

wait mitsuha 

i i 

i did what 

mitsuha 

could this could this mean 

no no no no could this mean that were really 

that were in our dreams that guy and i 

that were in our dreams that girl and i 

were switching places were switching places 

at last hello youve opened your eyes 

but why wont you even look me in the eyes whats wrong with you 

you angrily tell me that im late 

well im sorry but i did my best and running at my fastest pace 

im slowly beginning to realize whats going on 

takis in high school and living in tokyo 

two or three times a week ill suddenly and randomly switch with mitsuha whos somewhere out in the boonies 

the trigger is sleep the cause is unknown 

any memories i have of the switch get more and more hazy after i wake up 

but theres no doubt that were switching places 

the reactions of everyone around us prove it 

and thats why 

thats why we decided to lay out some ground rules so we could protect each others way of life 

things to watch out for during the switches and a list of stuff we should never do 

we also agreed to leave each other reports on our phones on the days we switch places 

so that we can work together to get through this weird thing thats happening 

and yet 

and yet 

i cannot believe this guy i cannot believe this girl 

back in the zenzenzense til this day 

been looking everywhere for you 

i followed the sound of your innocent laughter 

and it guided me in the right way 

even if every piece of you disappeared 

and if it scattered everywhere 

guys will stare watch the skirt 

these are basics for a girl 

its goin in your body plus i also worked for that money 

braiding cords is impossible 

cause you keep wasting money 

i wonder if we can push our way through 

the countless barrier thats waiting in the future just beyond our view 

side by side no way we can lose 

well beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules 

had tea with ms okudera on the way home you two have a good thing going 

quit messing with my relationships mitsuha 

hey taki why is a girl confessing her love to me 

maybe youre just more popular when im you 

youre so full of yourself like you have a girlfriend 

its not like you have anyone either 

i dont i dont 

because i dont want a relationship because i dont want a relationship 

i shouldnt for her sake 

you sure do like your own boobies 

time to go get ready 

over the course of the last few days the tiamat comet has been visible but when and where can people see it 

from east to west from our point of view 

why are you wearin your uniform 

grandma why does our shrine gods relic have to be kept so far away 

cause of mayugoro i dont really know 

whos mayugoro what hes famous 

hop on grandma 

oh watch out careful 

mitsuha yotsuha do you know about musubi 

mu subi 

its what we used to call the local guardian deity long ago and it means union 

this word has profound meaning 

tying strings together is a union connecting to people is a union and the flow of time is a union 

these are all part of the gods power the braided cords that we make are tied to that 

a skill from the god they represent the flow of time itself 

they assemble and take shape they twist tangle unravel now and then break 

and reconnect 

thats what a union is what time is 

have a drink thanks 

i want some too thats also a union 

whether its water rice or sake when something becomes a part of a person its a union 

it joins their soul which is why the offering were making today is such an important custom 

it connects the god with people 

hey i can see it 

this is where it is the sacred relic of miyamizu shrine 

what lies ahead is the hereafter its the netherworld 

the netherworld 

in order to return to this world you have to leave behind what is most important to you 

like the kuchikamizake 

kuchikamizake 

youll offer it at the foot of the shrine gods relic after all it is half of you 

half of mitsuha 

wow its already magic hour 

magic hour 

oh yeah maybe i can see the comet huh the comet 

oh mitsuha 

youre dreaming right now arent you 

im crying but why 

ms okudera shes almost where 

oh mitsuha what did you do 

date 

well thats what i had planned but 

hi taki huh agh 

wait long yeah aah no uh 

i just got here thank goodness lets go 

must be nice theyve probably met up about now 

huh 

why am i 

why 

it was a date i wanted to go on but if it so happens that you end up goin you better be grateful and enjoy it 

this is nice its my first time here so is this one of your usual go to spots 

at any rate i bet youve never even been on a single date 

no way its too expensive 

i dont know what to say to her 

thats why ive handpicked some links below to help you out ya wallflower 

for real 

shes making fun of me 

you know something taki 

today youre youre like a different person 

ms okudera you getting hungry we could get dinner 

uh lets call it a day u uh alright 

i could be wrong and im sorry if i am about 

but you used to have a little crush on me am i right 

but right now theres someone else you like huh 

uh its not that really 

theres no one its not like that are you sure about that 

well thanks for today see you at work 

by the time the dates over

what the festival 

ah 

oh yeah the comet itll be at its brightest today right 

okay got it seeya later 

youre just looking forward to seeing mitsuha in a yukata arentcha 

i i am not 

i mean it didnt even cross my mind 

yknow she sounded kinda down when i talked to her maybe she just didnt want a call from ya 

its not funny 

sorry to keep ya oh shes here youre late 

mitsuha what happened to 

your hair 

i guess its weird 

you think its gotta do with some guy like he broke her heart 

guys always just assume that it has to do with a boy 

she said she felt like cuttin it ya sure about that you really think she felt like cuttin off that much of it 

hey guys i can see it 

whoa ho ho whoa ah 

huh 

the number you are trying to reach is currently outside the cellular network or has been turned off due 

ill just have to tell her how lousy the date ended up the next time we switch 

thats what i thought 

but for some reason 

the switches mitsuha and i had been going through until now 

they never happened again 

wha 

what are 

what are you doing here 

tsukasa told me about it so here i am 

to cover my shift and to back up my alibi if my dad asked 

relax takagis gonna take your shift 

gotcha covered 

but you owe me dinner 

so youre all in on it youve got everyone worried about you 

huh we cant ignore this what if somebodys trying to pull one over on you 

like catfish 

i mean you met this person online didnt you 

no not exactly its kinda complicated 

could be from a dating site shes not 

its because youve been acting awfully fishy lately so were keeping an eye on you 

i dont need a babysitter okay 

the switches stopped my calls never connected and texts never went through 

thats why i decided to go see mitsuha in person 

i wanted to see her but 

what you dont know where she is exactly the towns landscape is your only clue 

yeah 

and you cant contact her whats that about 

where are we youre a terrible tour guide cause im not one 

oh well guess well help you search 

aww its so cute look taki seriously guys 

it moved awww 

this is a lost cause 

what what 

after everything that weve done for you today 

you havent done anything 

one takayama ramen one takayama ramen 

i guess ill have the same 

sure 

got it 

think we can make it back to tokyo tonight well i think well be cuttin it close 

let me take a look 

k thanks wait taki you sure about that 

yeah i kinda feel like maybe ive been barking up the wrong tree this whole time 

hey thats a sketch of itomori isnt it 

its drawn really well 

come take a look at this hon 

yeah thats itomori takes me back 

my husband was born and raised there you know 

itomori 

yes of course thats the place its nearby right 

you dont 

itomori was 

itomori 

but thats where wait isnt that the area where that comet 

huh 

hey 

is this place really where shes from 

no way taki must have just confused this with somewhere else 

no i didnt 

this was the place 

the schoolyard these mountains 

even this high school here 

i remember it all 

theres no way you could 

youve gotta know about that disaster three years ago right 

hundreds of people died they died 

three years ago 

it cant be 

theres no way 

i mean 

i still have the memos she wrote 

theyre fading 

comet tiamat with an orbital period of twelve hundred years 

made a close approach to earth three years ago in october 

nobody foresaw that its nucleus would split at its perigee 

a fragment that broke off of it became a meteor and struck japan 

it looks like that day was the same date as the autumn festival 

the point of impact was here 

at eight fourty two pm it fell right around where people were gathered for the festival 

over five hundred died 

it was a third of the towns population 

and now nobody lives in itomori anymore 

teshigawara 

and sayaka 

thats her 

you were wrong you gotta be 

after all this girl here died three years ago 

just two or three weeks ago she said that id be able to see the comet 

that means 

youre dreaming right now arent you i 

i 

what 

was i 

sounds lively over there 

they only have one room left im really sorry 

its not a problem 

hows taki 

hes still reading articles on itomori 

hes goin through all those newspapers and magazines at random seems obsessive 

what is it oh sorry you smoke huh 

yeah i did quit at one point 

what do you think about what takis been saying 

i had feelings for him yknow 

the way hes been recently 

i mean he was a nice guy before but hes even nicer now 

kind of frantic 

it was cute 

although i do think what hes been telling us is definitely strange sounding 

but in the end the fact remains that takis met someone and that someone is the reason he changed 

that much is for sure 

it was all just a dream 

i recognized the landscape 

because i unconsciously remembered the news from three years ago 

if its not that is she a ghost 

or 

did i just make it up 

the whole thing 

what was her name 

i cant remember 

tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath 

ms okudera 

uh 

i um 

i realize ive been saying a lot of strange things 

im really sorry and thank you 

braided cords pretty 

that band on your wrist 

thats one isnt it hm oh 

this thing guess so 

somebody 

someone gave it to me 

i wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm 

who was it 

its late why dont you go down and take a bath too sure wait 

yeah someone who makes these 

they once told me something 

the cords represent the flow of time 

they twist and tangle 

unravel and connect 

and thats what time is 

maybe if i could 

taki 

taki 

taki 

dont you remember 

taki 

eat this bento up there 

your drawing of itomori you did a real good job 

they assemble and take shape 

they twist tangle 

unravel now and then 

break 

and reconnect 

thats what a union is 

what time is 

there it is 

its really there 

it wasnt 

a dream 

what lies ahead is the netherworld 

its still here 

this was yotsuhas and this was mine 

this was before the comet 

so when i switched places with her 

it was also three years in the past 

our times got tangled somehow 

this is half of her 

musubi 

if its true and time can be unraveled 

just give me one more chance 

agh 

a comet 

ngh hh 

your names going to be 

mitsuha 

both of you are my treasures 

youre going to be a big sister 

im so sorry my dears 

dad when is mommy coming home 

i couldnt help her get ahold of yourself 

who cares about the shrine but youre in charge now 

i loved futaba not miyamizu shrine get out 

now listen to me girls 

starting today youll be living with grandma 

who are you 

dont be full of yourself 

like you have a girlfriend 

must be nice 

theyve probably met up about now 

why am i 

im going to tokyo what wait sis 

grandma 

would you mind doing me a favor 

oh yeah the comet 

itll be at its brightest today right 

mitsuha dont go there 

mitsuha 

youve gotta get out of town before the comet strikes 

mitsuha run 

mitsuha mitsuha mitsuha 

mitsuha 

shes alive 

let me guess youre touching your boo 

her sister 

yotsuha 

ungh 

i think shes finally lost it 

just for today i im gonna head out first 

shes lost it 

really lost it 

totally 

totally 

for all you stargazers out there the comet tiamat has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now 

tonight it will finally reach its perigee around seven fourty pm and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the earths 

its tonight theres still time left 

mornin mitsuha 

whats this 

hold on 

youre not mitsuha are you w wait how did you 

you already knew 

no but watching the way youve been behaving lately stirred some memories up 

when i was a young girl 

i had some pretty strange dreams myself 

huh 

though its been so long the memories of who i became in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point 

faded 

treasure the experience dreams eventually will fade away 

i went through similar times myself 

and so did your mother 

what if 

all those dreams that the miyamizu people had 

it had to do with today 

grandma you have to listen to me 

tonight 

the comet is going to fall on itomori 

youre all gonna die huh 

nobodys gonna believe that 

i didnt expect that out of mitsuhas grandma 

it doesnt matter theres no way im gonna let them all die 

mitsuha 

what happened to 

whatd you 

your hair 

ugh the haircut looked better before huh no i i its good 

nevermind that if we dont do something about tonight well all die 

its up to us to save everyone 

wait shouldnt you be in school 

well we sort of have to save the town or something 

heh 

the warning system yeah those speakers all over the town 

i get it it could work 

nice job teshi hey i dont think you should be sittin so close to me 

whats wrong uh oh you shy would you quit it 

it aint proper and you know it 

t hahahahaha 

such a gentleman 

i bought all the snacks guys 

heres the change sorry for the trouble 

i didnt mind 

we oughta be gettin paid quit complaining 

so whadcha come up with 

got an evacuation plan 

a a 

a bomb 

yeah we have water gel explosives we use for construction at our storage site 

and the warning system 

our startup frequency can hijack the towns warning system pretty easily 

so we can broadcast an evacuation warning for the whole town right from school 

look were outside the disaster area here 

so well just make an announcement to evacuate to the school 

its 

its totally a crime youll be in charge of the broadcast saya 

why me youre in the broadcast club 

and ill be in charge of the explosives while i go have a word with the mayor 

why cause if the evacuation orders not comin from town hall then nobodys gonna go anyway 

but if i talk to the mayor as his daughter i can convince him 

its the perfect plan 

fine i dont really care one way or the other 

this is just a theory of yours right 

well 

theories can be based on reality like do you know the story of how itomori lake was formed its a crater 

that means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago right thats why

what is goin on so stay on standby 

come on they said everyone should evacuate the high schools the evacuation center 

katsuhiko 

tell me 

what do you think youre doing 

sorry mitsuha 

this is the end 

oh my god 

its actually splittin apart 

look at that the comet has split into two large parts and meteors are now falling to earth 

uh i dont believe anyone could have predicted this either way we have quite the mystical view here 

so what does the comets nucleus splitting mean for us 

the comets not within the roche limit so the nucleus itself mustve had a structural weakness for this to happen 

comet shoemaker levy nine broke apart and collided with jupiter in nineteen ninety four 

there were at least twenty one fragments im going outside to take a look 

the fragments will likely burn up well before reaching the ground does it pose a danger 

probability of a meteor actually landing on a populated area is quite small 

never foresaw this development 

to predict the trajectory as we stand here witnessing this spectacle 

unassisted 

and with our bare eyes 

it strikes me that living in such an age has never felt more fortunate than now 

hey 

who 

are you 

who 

who 

who is he 

someone precious 

someone i shouldnt forget 

someone i didnt want to 

who 

who 

who are you 

whats your name 

oh no 

ah argh 

ungh 

so that we dont forget things when we wake up 

lets write down our names 

writing this 

doesnt help 

i wont know your name 

dad 

mitsuha there you are 

dont tell me youre back 

ah 

it was almost like seeing something out of a dream 

nothing more or less 

than a breathtaking view 

words like tomorrow or future or fate 

no matter how far they extend their hands 

we breathe we dream we raise our love 

in a timeless land that is far out of reach 

even the second hour hands of the clock 

they look at us sideways as they tick and tock 

how i hope to have forever to spend this life 

no all future lives 

right here in this world with you 

huh 

why am i here 

what am i doing 

u uh 

the doors are closing please be careful 

im always searching for something 

this feeling has consumed me 

for some time 

the reason i applied for this position 

the landscapes people live in 

to build a citys landscape 

even tokyo it might vanish too one day 

and so i wanna make landscapes that how should i put this 

that can continue to warm peoples hearts 

that bad how many does that make it 

doesnt sound too promising 

who asked you that suit could be the problem 

it looks just like yours 

well i have two offers i have eight myself 

is what im searching for 

someone 

or somewhere 

or am i just searching for the right job 

i dont even really know 

oh 

youre job hunting huh i havent had much luck though 

hey maybe its the suit thats killing your chances uh does it really look that bad on me 

so why the sudden call today 

i was in the area for work and i figured it had been a while since i saw your face 

remember that one time when we went all the way to itomori 

you were still in high school back then so it was 

heh five years ago that long 

it seems like 

ive forgotten a lot 

i dont remember all that much either 

about back then 

maybe we argued 

she and tsukasa went back to tokyo without me 

i spent the night alone on some mountain 

thats about all i remember 

but at one point in time i found myself strangely drawn to the incident involving that comet 

a fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster 

but miraculously 

most of the people living in the town were unhurt 

the town happened to be holding an emergency drill that day 

and most of its residents were outside the impact zone 

the sheer luck and coincidence of it all sparked various conspiracy theories 

i read a lot articles about it back then 

i was kind of obsessed 

but whatever the reason i had for my interest is a mystery to me now 

i didnt even know anybody in that town 

thanks for today this is far enough 

i do hope 

that at some point 

youll find happiness too 

i feel like im always searching 

for something 

someone 

i feel like i do wanna go to one more bridal fair 

theyre all the same 

a shinto weddin sure sounds nice too you said you wanted to be married in a chapel 

oh that reminds me teshi uh 

would ya please shave before the ceremony im goin on a diet for it you know 

she says as shes eatin a cake 

ill get serious tomorrow uh 

the landscape of a town thats no longer there 

why does looking at it make my chest feel so tight 

now just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stay here a little longer now 

just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stick together just a little bit longer 

just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stay here a little longer now 

now just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stick together just a little bit longer 

searching for 

someone 

oh yes we are time fliers 

scaling the walls of time climber 

tired of playing hide and seek with time and 

always comin dead short 

ill never let you go now 

promise i will never let you go now 

cause my hand finally has reached yours 

why should i have to 

oh youre sure quite a showy crier 

wanna stop your tears 

see your eyes drier 

but when i went to wipe your tears dry 

you refused but i saw them pouring down your face i knew why 

crying even when youre happy 

smiling even when youre feeling lonely 

its because a part of you 

has made it here before the rest has 

excuse me 

havent we 

have i 

met you somewhere 

i thought so too 

can i ask you can i ask you 

your name your name 

the sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me 

where did it find the loneliness it carried on the breeze 

looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears 

i could see for miles of blue its never been so clear 

speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair 

somehow i feel a warmth and comfort today 

your ever kind heart the way you smile and even how you find your dreams 

i knew nothing so honestly ive always copied you 

now just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stay here a little longer now 

now just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stick together just a little bit longer 

oh yes we are time fliers 

scaling the walls of time climber 

tired of playing hide and seek with time and 

always comin dead short 

crying even when youre happy 

smiling even when youre feeling lonely 

its because a part of you has made it here before the rest has 

i used to wish upon the stars the toys that i once adored 

forgotten now are rollin round the corners of the floor 

finally my dream has counted up to a hundred today 

someday ill trade them all for just the very one 

girl that i have seen in school that never have told hello 

after class today i waved and said see you tomorrow 

its not really that bad trying something new every once in a while 

especially if i can do it with you by my side 

now just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stay here a little longer now 

just a little more 

only just a little more 

lets stick together just a little bit longer 

oh yes we are time fliers so and i 

i knew who you were way before 

way before i even knew my own name 

theres no clue but im sure i swear 

even if youre not around in this wide world 

of course it surely would have some kind of meaning 

but if when youre not around in this crazy world 

would be like the month of august without summer break 

and if youre not around in this great world 

would be like santa claus without any glee 

if youre not around in this wide world 

oh yes we are time fliers 

scaling the walls of time climber 

tired of playing hide and seek with time and 

always comin dead short 

no never mind that 

no never mind what i said now 

cause im on my way to you 

oh we are time fliers 

dashing up the steps of time now 

no more playing hide and seek with you and time 

and always comin dead short 

youre quite a showy crier 

wanna stop your tears 

see your eyes drier 

but when i went to wipe your tears dry 

you refused but i saw them pouring down your face i knew why 

crying even when im happy 

smiling even when im feeling lonely 

its because the heart of mine 

has made it here before my body

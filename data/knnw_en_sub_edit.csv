2;58700;61440;"That's when everything happens now and again."
3;62060;66540;"Whatever that dream was I had, I can never remember it."
4;66540;69550;"- But... - But..."
5;69550;72190;"the only thing that does last when I wake up"
6;72190;74190;"is a sense of loss,"
7;74560;77190;"which lingers for a long time afterwards."
8;83850;86700;"I'm always searching for something"
9;86700;88700;"or someone."
10;88750;91090;"Mitsuha: I've been consumed by this feeling..."
11;91920;94090;"ever since that day."
12;95040;98910;"Taki: The day... a star fell."
13;98910;100460;"It was almost like..."
14;100460;102450;"-like seeing something out of a dream."
15;103760;106450;"Nothing more or less..."

19;118100;119610;"and of time"
20;119910;124790;"instead of fading into air and dust."
21;124790;127840;"Then what will the words, could it ever be"
22;127840;130540;"farthest words from "probably"?"
23;130550;133050;"Let's make a promise that will never fade."
24;133050;136830;"Let's say it together on the count of three, oh."
25;147750;150960;"Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard,"
26;150960;153730;"but lately I've lost sight of the truth in those words."
27;153730;156980;"I can't even remember when I gave up believing."
28;156980;158550;"What could have been the reason?"
29;158550;161870;"Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop"
30;161870;164410;"in the place rainbow born and dies."
31;164410;166350;"And where the end of this life lies,"

38;196290;197660;"I'm on my way to you,"

41;226140;227890;"Taki."
42;227890;229900;"Taki!"

44;235290;238330;"My name is..."
45;238330;239020;"Mitsuha!"
46;275200;278010;"Sis, what are you... doing?"
47;278030;281390;"Whoa, they're so realistic-feeling..."
48;282200;283110;"Sis?"
49;283110;284220;"Me?"
50;284220;285880;"Are you still asleep?"
51;285880;289010;"Breakfast time, hurry up!"
52;308600;310050;"Huh?"
53;310050;311420;"Wha-?"
54;311640;313260;"WHAAAT?!"
55;319930;322490;"Do you wanna have any of last night's fish, grandma?"
56;322490;324190;"You can eat it."
57;324710;326210;"- Mornin'! - Mornin'!"
58;326210;328330;"Lazy butt, you're so slow!"
59;328330;330540;"I'll fix breakfast tomorrow."
60;335930;337490;"Oh, that's a lot..."
61;337490;338850;"-Oh, well."
62;338850;341060;"- You're back to normal today. - Huh?"
63;341060;345750;"- You were so crazy yesterday. - What do you mean, "crazy"?"
64;346690;349380;"-Attention, citizens of Itomori."
65;349380;350650;"Good morning!"
66;350650;354400;"This is an official announcement from Itomori Town Hall."
67;354400;357330;"It is in regards to the mayoral election."
68;357330;360390;"The election will be held on the 20th of next month."
69;360760;364240;"The election committee would like to remind everyone tha-"
71;366720;370040;"A comet that comes only once every 1,200 years"
72;370040;372770;"will finally be headed our way in a month."
73;372770;377120;"The comet will be visible to the naked eye for several days once it approaches the Earth..."
74;377120;379270;"Just make up with him already, okay?"
75;379270;385360;"- That's an adult matter. - According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're preparing for the celestial show of the millennium."
78;401430;403120;"- We're leaving! - We're leaving!"
79;406390;410550;"Yotsuha: I can't wait 'til the festival! It's gonna be so much fun!"
80;423600;425570;"Study hard, sis!"
81;428400;429860;"Ah!"
82;430850;432420;"Mitsuha!"
83;432420;434370;"Good mornin', Saya! Mornin', Teshi!"
84;434370;437040;"- Mornin'! - Come on, would you get off already?"
85;437040;439160;"- What for, meanie? - 'Cause you're heavy."
86;439160;442360;"- Hey, that's rude! - Y'know, I gotta say. You two make a great couple."
87;442360;444050;"- No, we don't! - No, we don't!"
88;445730;448930;"Oh, I see you actually bothered to do your hair today."
89;448930;452780;"-Wait, what? -Oh, yeah. What happened? Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?"
90;452780;456200;"- Exorcise? - Somethin' totally possessed your body!"
91;456200;459190;"Would you just give it a rest with all this occult nonsense?"
92;459190;463660;"- Mitsuha's gotta be feelin' stressed enough as it is, right? - What are you guys talking about?"
93;463660;465660;"Are you feelin' okay?"
94;466910;473710;"And above all, restoring the town's fiscal health so we can continue our revitalization project."
95;473710;479610;"It's only when all these things are achieved that we can create a safe and secure community."
96;479920;484900;"- As the incumbent, my administration... - Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway."
97;484900;488270;"I hear he's been dullin' out the pork. Just between us."
98;488270;491450;"- Hey, Miyamizu. - Mornin'."
99;491450;495650;"Looks like the mayor and the contractor's kid are pretty cozy, too."
100;495650;499790;"-To improve the quality of life of each and every resident."
101;500840;502540;"- Mitsuha! - [Gasp]"
102;502670;505140;"Stand up straight when you're walking!"
103;505550;507510;"Oh, he's tough on his family."
104;507510;508970;"Well, that's the mayor for ya."
105;508970;511420;"- Awkward. - Sucks to be her."
106;512420;514140;"Mitsuha!"
107;514830;516480;"In front of everyone."
110;530450;534010;"Two light. That's the origin of the word twilight."
111;534010;536770;"I'm sure everyone here knows that word."
112;536770;540220;"It's dusk, a time when It's neither day nor night."
113;540500;542690;"When the border between worlds blur,"
114;542690;545670;"and one might encounter something not human."
115;546510;550350;"Another older term for it is dusk light."
116;550350;553510;"Some people also call it "golden hour"."
118;553510;556370;"-What about "magic hour"? It's something my grandma says."
119;556370;560140;"-Well, golden hour and magic hour are technically the same,"
120;560140;562860;"but it's a term that mostly photographers use."
122;563300;566780;"- Well, she does take a lot of pictures. - [CLASS Laughing]"
123;568090;569980;"-Okay, next..."
124;569980;572330;"- Miyamizu! - Uh, yes?"
125;572330;575700;"Well, I can see that you remember your own name today."
126;579000;581660;"Sayaka: You... don't remember? mitsuha: Uh-uh..."
127;581660;585880;"Well, believe it or not, you forgot where your own desk and locker were yesterday."
128;585880;589980;"Plus, you had the worst case of bedhead, and you didn't have your ribbon on, either!"
129;592860;594540;"What?! No way!"
130;594540;597190;"Yeah, it was like you had amnesia or somethin'."
131;597190;601840;"Now that you mention it, I do feel like I've been havin' weird dreams lately."
132;601840;605860;"Like a dream about someone else's life?"
133;606020;608120;"It's all so fuzzy."
134;608120;610660;"Wait a sec, I've got it..."
135;610660;612420;"It's memories from a previous life,"
136;612420;616250;"or maybe your subconscious linked to the Everett interpretation of the multiverse!"
137;616250;617570;"Keep your full mouth shut!"
138;617570;622390;"Wait a minute! Teshi, don't tell me you were the one who wrote in my noteboo... k."
139;623080;624510;"Forget it."
140;625170;629500;"But you really were actin' just a little funny yesterday, Mitsuha."
141;629800;631730;"You been feelin' okay?"
142;632450;635450;"That's what's weird. I feel fine."
143;635580;639600;"Maybe it's from stress. You know, you've got that ritual comin' up soon, don'tcha?"
144;639600;641800;"Ugh, don't remind me!"
145;641800;646380;"I can't stand this place anymore! It's too small and town-ey."
146;646380;650870;"I wanna graduate already and go to Tokyo as soon as I can!"
147;650960;656130;"-Can't say I blame you. There really Is nothin' at all in this town."
148;657100;661660;"-There's only one train that stops here every two hours -and all the stores close at nine o' clock."
149;661660;663770;"No bookstores, no dentists,"
151;663770;666140;"but two cocktail lounges for whatever reason."
152;666140;668620;"- No jobs in town. - No one date-able."
153;668620;671230;"Even the days are too short."
154;672340;673470;"You know what?!"
155;673470;675150;"- No, what? - No, what?"
156;675960;678500;"Forget that stuff. why don't we go to a café?"
157;678500;679960;"- A café? - Really?"
158;679960;681260;"- Where?! - Where?!"
159;685820;686800;"Hello, kids!"
160;686800;688160;"- Hi, there! - Evenin', ma'am!"
161;693050;696740;"- How is this a café? - Like this town's got a café."
162;697050;699680;"Mitsuha just went straight home."
163;700670;705480;"- Things have gotta be really rough for her right now. - She's on center stage and all."
164;705480;706480;"Yeah..."
165;709810;712440;"- Hey, Teshi... - Hm?"
166;712800;715900;"What are you gonna do after you graduate high school?"
167;715900;718880;"Where'd that come from? you talkin' about the future?"
168;718880;720370;"Mh-hm."
169;720660;725950;"I dunno. I think I'll probably just end up livin' in this town, y'know. Same as ever."
170;741880;743940;"I wanna do what you're doin'."
171;743940;746850;"It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha."
172;746850;749380;"Listen to the thread's voice."
173;749380;755880;"When you twine it round and round like this, feelings will start flowing between you and the thread."
174;756710;760950;"- It's not like threads talk... - She's telling you to focus."
175;760950;766570;"Etched within our braided cords is a thousand years' worth of Itomori's history."
176;766570;770620;"Listen. Somethin' happened two hundred years ago..."
177;770620;772040;"Here she goes."
178;772040;779170;"The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki caught on fire and this whole area burned down."
179;779270;782650;"The shrine and old Documents were destroyed."
180;782840;786070;"- This is known as... - Mayugoro's Great Fire."
181;786320;790600;"They named the fire after him?! I feel bad for Mayugoro."
182;791390;795150;"The meaning behind our festivals was lost because of that."
183;795150;797740;"Only the surface was left."
184;797740;802040;"But even if those words are gone, those words shouldn't fade."
185;802040;806530;"That's the Miyamizu shrine's duty. our important task."
186;807220;808830;"Ugh..."
187;808830;812660;"Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine!"
188;812660;818360;"Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving this house were bad enough, but politics?!"
189;818360;821010;"Oh, he's hopeless!"
190;821460;823540;"-Have another, mister foreman."
191;826570;830390;"- I'll be counting on your help again for this election. - Leave it to me."
192;830390;834320;"You'll get the votes from the Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts, guaranteed."
193;834320;837960;"- How's the datin' scene? - It ain't easy, that's for sure."
194;839350;843520;"- Smells like corruption in there. - What are you talkin' about?"
195;844000;847280;"- We're gonna need two or three more bottles. - Yes, dear."
196;847280;850310;"Katsuhiko, you're gonna help out at the site this weekend."
197;850310;853520;"- We'll be usin' explosives, so you better study up. - Grngh."
198;853520;854580;"What was that?!"
199;854580;856580;"Got it!"
200;869280;871930;"Guess we both can't stand things here."
201;890460;893180;"Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up."
202;893180;895900;"They're lookers, alright. Just like their mother."
203;897550;900520;"- Heya! - Hey."
204;932330;934700;"World's oldest kind of sake,"
205;934700;940660;"but chewin' on rice, spittin' it out, and then lettin' it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol."
206;940660;942660;"Kuchikamizake."
207;942790;945720;"Do the gods really appreciate that. the way it's ma-"
208;945720;947910;"Yeah, of course they do!"
209;949660;953010;"Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu."
210;957500;964030;"-Ugh! I'd never do that! -And in front of everybody! Embarrassing, right?"
211;977550;979870;"You should try to cheer up, sis."
212;980040;983010;"Who cares if a few of the kids from your school saw that?"
213;983010;985940;"It must be nice for you not being a teenager."
214;986410;991000;"Hey, I know! You should just sell Kuchikamizake and move to Tokyo!"
215;991000;995860;"I bet you could sell it with all sorts of stuff like photos and making-of videos."
216;995860;1001910;"Oh, and then you can call it "Shrine maiden's Sake"! You'll make buttloads!"
218;1004600;1008280;"I can't! There are liquor laws!"
219;1008280;1010470;"That's what you have a problem with?"
220;1016430;1021320;"I hate this town! I hate this life, too!"
221;1021320;1028690;"Please make me a handsome tokyo boy in my next life!"
222;1030140;1032770;"Yotsuha: What a jackass."
223;1060320;1061820;"Ow..."
224;1074290;1075480;"Where...?"
225;1076150;1077260;"Huh?"
226;1083520;1084840;"Hmm?"
227;1086610;1089020;"Something's... there..."
228;1093900;1095040;"Aaaah!"
229;1102810;1103810;"Eh!"
230;1103880;1105840;"Taki's Father: Taki, you up?"
231;1107940;1111780;"It was your turn to cook breakfast, wasn't it? Did you sleep in?"
232;1111950;1113690;"I'm sorry."
233;1114020;1116040;"Ugh, I'm heading out."
234;1116040;1119110;"- Finish the miso. - Uh, okay..."
235;1119110;1122640;"Make sure you go to school, Even if you're late. Seeya."
236;1123280;1125550;"H-have a nice day."
237;1136140;1137860;"What a strange dream..."
239;1143140;1146080;"Huh? It's from "Tsukasa"?"
240;1146580;1148990;"Who's that? Hrm."
241;1153780;1155160;"Uhhh..."
242;1157280;1159660;"I gotta go pee."
243;1168160;1170430;"Way too real..."
245;1240840;1243750;"I'm in Tokyo!"
247;1250060;1251840;"- Where did you get this? - Daikanyama."
248;1251840;1253360;"Guess who's opening at our next gig?"
249;1253360;1257180;"- W-wait wait, we have a gig? - Hey, let's skip club stuff today and catch a movie."
250;1259790;1260850;"Uh..."
251;1261690;1263710;"Taaaki!"
252;1264540;1267660;"Can't believe you got in at noon. come on, let's grab lunch!"
253;1268780;1271250;"You ignored my text, too!"
254;1271250;1275380;"- Mr. Tsukasa. - "Mister"? You don't have to go that far."
255;1276690;1278870;"- You got lost? - Yeah."
256;1278900;1283030;"Wait a second. How'd you wind up getting lost on the way to school?"
257;1283030;1284110;"Uh..."
258;1284110;1286900;"-Well, a girl- -A girl?"
259;1286900;1287870;"A gal-"
260;1287870;1288600;"- Hm? - Hm?"
261;1288600;1289500;"I mean..."
262;1289500;1290390;"- Huh?! - Huh?!"
263;1290390;1291400;"A guy..."
264;1293320;1299830;"Y'know, guys just wanna have fun. Every day's a festival when you're living in Tokyo... as a guy."
265;1299830;1302160;"Hey, you... sound funny."
266;1302170;1304260;"-And where's your lunch?"
267;1304260;1306950;"- Seriously? - What is up with you?"
268;1306950;1310370;"- We could share somethin'. - Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich."
269;1310460;1312310;"-Yes! Hahahaha!"
270;1312930;1314730;"Ah..."
271;1314730;1316410;"Thank you!"
272;1317810;1321190;"- Wanna hit the café later? - Oh, that one? Sure."
273;1321190;1322000;"-You in, Taki?"
274;1322000;1325080;"-What? What?! WHAT?!"
275;1325080;1326360;"A café?!"
276;1329510;1333580;"- They've got nice timberwork in here. - Yeah, it's pretty intricate."
277;1333950;1335720;"Taki, all set?"
278;1335720;1337630;"Uh...[Gasp]"
279;1337630;1340860;"I could live for a whole month on what these pancakes cost!"
280;1341450;1343900;"-Uh... maybe a decade ago."
281;1343900;1345850;"-Hmmm..."
282;1345850;1348380;"Oh, well! It's only a dream!"
283;1354510;1356880;"Dreams are great!"
284;1357020;1359020;"Huh?"
285;1361560;1364970;"Wha? Oh no! I think that I'm late for work."
286;1365160;1368260;"- You got a shift today? - Guess you better get goin'."
287;1368260;1370460;"Right."
288;1371110;1373710;"Sorry, but uh..."
289;1373710;1376470;"Where exactly do I work?"
290;1376470;1377910;"- Wha? - Wha?"
291;1383940;1388430;"- Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting! - Table twelve! Taki!"
292;1388430;1389490;"Got it!"
293;1389700;1391020;"Here you go."
294;1391020;1394250;"So, the zucchini and tomato salad with a side of..."
295;1394350;1395590;"- We didn't order that! - Wha?"
296;1395590;1400320;"- Taki! I told you that we are out of truffles! - Taki, you gotta talk louder!"
297;1400320;1401500;"Taki!"
298;1402610;1404940;"When is this nightmare gonna be over?!"
299;1413260;1414500;"Diner: Waiter."
300;1414780;1418080;"- Hey, you. - Uh, yes?"
301;1418880;1422420;"See this? Does it look right? a toothpick's in it."
302;1422730;1425420;"What would have happened if we ate it?"
303;1425710;1428370;"It's really lucky I noticed when I did."
304;1428940;1432790;"-Do something. -Uh... it's just that..."
305;1432850;1436770;"Well, I don't even think we have toothpicks at this-"
306;1436770;1438820;"What?!"
307;1438820;1442450;"Excuse me. Is everything alright over here?"
308;1442450;1445760;"- Well, like I was trying to tell the guy... - I'll take care of this."
309;1446250;1448420;"What's wrong with you today?"
310;1449300;1452690;"We truly apologize. your meal is on the house tonight."
311;1452690;1453840;"Why, thank you."
312;1454030;1456490;"You weren't hurt, were you?"
313;1466660;1470710;"- Uh... Oku... dera? - That's "Miss" to you."
314;1470990;1474740;"-Miss Okudera. About before- -We just had some bad luck is all."
315;1474740;1478260;"-No, I- I- -Those guys were definitely scamming us."
316;1478260;1481330;"I handled it according to the manual, but still..."
317;1481660;1484570;"Uh-Ms. Okudera, your skirt!"
318;1485800;1488000;"- Are you alright? - Did something happen?"
319;1488000;1489920;"Looks like someone cut it."
320;1489920;1491910;"That guy..."
321;1492340;1494910;"- Do you remember what he looked like? - No..."
322;1494980;1498750;"- Come with me. - Hey, Taki."
323;1499390;1500730;"Okay, take off your skirt."
324;1500730;1501590;"What?!"
325;1501590;1503360;"N- wh- I'll... I'll look the other way!"
326;1507830;1509850;"Hold on, this won't take long."
327;1514090;1516520;"All done! Ta-da!"
328;1516840;1520510;"You're really good, Taki! It's way cuter now!"
329;1521770;1526620;"By the way, I wanted to thank you for all your help with that customer earlier."
330;1527130;1531000;"To be honest, well... I was worried about you."
331;1531000;1535000;"You aren't that strong, but you're quick to pick a fight."
332;1535000;1537040;"I like you better today."
333;1537280;1540720;"You've got a feminine side. who woulda guessed?"
335;1551390;1555220;"I gotta say, this dream sure does seem real."
336;1559290;1562080;"Ah, looks like he keeps a journal."
337;1566290;1567990;"So organized."
338;1568590;1571490;"I wish I lived in Tokyo."
339;1574890;1576670;"One of her."
340;1581280;1583830;"Unrequited love?"
344;1626940;1629380;"What is this?"
346;1632520;1633810;"Wha?!"
347;1633810;1635300;"What?!"
349;1635300;1637200;"What is going on?!"
350;1638590;1640140;"So, café today?"
351;1640200;1642530;"Thanks, but I gotta go to work."
352;1642530;1644700;"Ha, do you remember where to go?"
353;1644700;1646680;"Huh?...Ah!"
354;1646680;1650740;"Wait a second. Was that you, Tsukasa? Are you the one that's been messing with my phone?"
355;1650790;1653370;"Uh... Never mind."
356;1653690;1655120;"Later."
357;1655120;1657720;"Well, he's back to normal."
358;1657720;1660440;"I think he was kinda... cute yesterday."
359;1660440;1662420;"Uhhhhh...."
360;1664050;1666160;"Uh... what's up?"
361;1666160;1668480;"Don't play dumb. what about bro code, huh?!"
362;1668480;1671420;"Yeah, you walked home with her yesterday, right?"
363;1671940;1675630;"Uh, what are you talking about? me and Ms. Okudera?"
364;1675630;1677310;"- So what did you guys do?! - So what did you guys do?! - So what did you guys do?!"
365;1677310;1680630;"Uh, well... I don't remember, actually."
366;1680630;1682610;"Quit messin' around and tell us!"
367;1682610;1685540;"Okudera, reporting for duty!"
368;1685990;1691400;"-Don't slack off today, you guys. we're gonna have a good day today. -Yeah..."
369;1691400;1693780;"Aren't we, Taki?"
370;1701370;1702900;"Hmmm?"
372;1706930;1709900;"Yotsuha: I see you're not touching your boobies today."
373;1709900;1712980;"Breakfast time! Hurry up!"
374;1715820;1717050;"MY BOOBS?!"
375;1719510;1721640;"Mornin'!"
376;1726650;1730220;"I feel like everyone's starin' at me for some reason."
377;1730460;1734680;"- Well you did kinda make a scene yesterday. - Uh?!"
379;1736210;1738320;"-Did you see all the election posters?"
380;1738320;1741490;"-Doesn't matter who wins, nothin'll change, 'cept for who gets the kickback."
381;1741490;1746010;"-Shhh! Somebody's daddy's dependent on it."
382;1746200;1748080;"-They're talking about me, right?"
383;1748080;1750460;"Uh... [Nod]"
384;1750760;1752740;"Wait, Mitsuha?!"
385;1762210;1765020;"I... I..."
386;1765470;1767220;"I did what?!"
387;1769380;1771220;"Mitsuha?"
389;1777860;1780730;"Could this... could this mean-"
390;1780730;1785030;"-No, no, no, no! Could this mean... that we're really-"
391;1785480;1788400;"That we're... In our dreams, that guy and I-"
392;1788400;1791430;"That we're... In our dreams, that girl and I-"
395;1792290;1793540;"- We're switching places?! - We're switching places?!"
396;1808380;1813140;"At last, hello, you've opened your eyes,"
397;1813140;1818690;"but why won't you even look me in the eyes, what's wrong with you?"
398;1818690;1823250;"You angrily tell me that I'm late."
399;1823250;1827990;"Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best and running at my fastest pace!"
400;1827990;1830740;"Mitsuha: I'm slowly beginning to realize what's going on."
401;1830850;1834200;"Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo."
402;1834860;1840490;"Taki: Two or three times a week, I'll suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha, who's somewhere out in the boonies."
403;1840500;1844540;"The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown."
405;1844580;1849390;"Mitsuha: Any memories I have of the switch get more and more hazy after I wake up."
406;1849390;1852450;"Taki: But there's no doubt that we're switching places."
407;1852450;1855150;"The reactions of everyone around us prove it."
408;1855150;1856620;"And that's why..."
409;1856620;1861730;"Mitsuha: That's why we decided to lay out some ground rules so we could protect each other's way of life."
412;1861730;1866530;"Things to watch out for during the switches, and a list of stuff we should never do."
414;1866600;1871160;"Taki: We also agreed to leave each other reports on our phones on the days we switch places..."
415;1871160;1875560;"Mitsuha: So that we can work together to get through this... weird thing that's happening."
416;1876160;1877570;"-And yet..."
417;1877630;1879030;"-And yet..."
418;1879430;1881520;"- I cannot believe this guy! - I cannot believe this girl!"
419;1881520;1884100;"Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,"
420;1884100;1886100;"been looking everywhere for you."
421;1886100;1888590;"I followed the sound of your innocent laughter,"
422;1888590;1891690;"and it guided me in the right way."
423;1891690;1894210;"Even if every piece of you disappeared"
424;1894210;1896450;"and if it scattered everywhere..."
425;1896450;1899110;"Mitsuha: Guys will stare. Watch the skirt!"
426;1899110;1901810;"These are basics for a girl!"
428;1904250;1909410;"Taki: Stop wasting my money on sweets! mitsuha: It's goin' in your body. Plus, I also worked for that money."
430;1909410;1911070;"Taki: Braiding cords is impossible!"
431;1911070;1914660;"Mitsuha: You work way too many shifts! taki: 'Cause you keep wasting money!"
432;1914660;1919210;"I wonder if we can push our way through"
433;1919210;1924910;"the countless barrier that's waiting In the future just beyond our view."
434;1924910;1929420;"Side-by-side, no way we can lose."
435;1929420;1934520;"We'll beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules."
436;1935040;1939700;"Mitsuha: Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the way home. You two have a good thing going!"
437;1939700;1943210;"Taki: Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha!"
438;1943210;1946850;"-Hey, Taki... why is a girl confessing her love to me?"
439;1946850;1949350;"-Maybe you're just more Popular when I'm you."
440;1949350;1952490;"-You're so full of yourself! like you have a girlfriend!"
442;1952490;1953970;"-It's not like you have anyone, either!"
443;1953970;1955720;"- I don't... - I don't..."
446;1955720;1957870;"- Because I don't want a relationship! - Because I don't want a relationship!"
447;1979500;1982210;"I shouldn't for her sake."
448;1985390;1987710;"Yotsuha: You sure do like your own boobies."
449;1987970;1991960;"Time to go! Get ready!"
450;1993000;1999810;"Over the course of the last few days, the Tiamat comet has been visible, but when and where can people see it?"
452;1999930;2006980;"The Tiamat comet will be moving in the same direction the sun does: from East to West from our point of view."
453;2007450;2010310;"Why are you wearin' your uniform?"
454;2017900;2023370;"Yotsuha: Grandma, why does our shrine god's relic have to be kept so far away?"
455;2023370;2026830;"'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know."
456;2026830;2030420;"- Who's Mayugoro? - What? He's famous!"
457;2038150;2040340;"Hop on, grandma."
458;2044570;2046780;"- Oh! - Watch out! Careful!"
459;2057740;2062070;"Mitsuha. Yotsuha. Do you know about Musubi?"
460;2062070;2063200;"Mu... subi?"
461;2063200;2069060;"It's what we used to call the local guardian Deity long ago, and it means "union"."
462;2069060;2072300;"This word has profound meaning."
463;2072300;2080300;"Tying strings together is a union, connecting to People is a union, and the flow of time is a union."
464;2080870;2087710;"These are all part of the god's power. The braided cords that we make are tied to that."
465;2087710;2093270;"A skill from the god, they represent the flow of time itself."
466;2093970;2101940;"They assemble and take shape. They twist, tangle, unravel now and then, break..."
467;2101940;2104050;"and reconnect."
468;2104230;2108240;"That's what a union is. What time is."
469;2111310;2114080;"- Have a drink. - Thanks."
470;2114560;2119100;"- I want some, too! - That's also a union."
471;2119650;2126310;"Whether it's water, rice or sake, when something becomes a part of a person, it's a union."
472;2126310;2132960;"It joins their soul, which is why the offering we're making today is such an important custom."
473;2132960;2136350;"It connects the god with people."
474;2137990;2140110;"Hey, I can see it!"
475;2142990;2148980;"This is where it is. the sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine."
476;2164220;2170490;"What lies ahead is the hereafter. It's the netherworld."
477;2171780;2174360;"The netherworld!"
478;2175950;2183170;"In order to return to this world, you have to leave behind what is most important to you."
479;2185160;2188380;"Like the kuchikamizake."
480;2188400;2190230;"Kuchikamizake?"
481;2190230;2197160;"You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic. After all, it is half of you."
482;2198830;2201670;"Half... of Mitsuha."
483;2218970;2222010;"Wow, it's already magic hour!"
484;2222090;2224010;"Magic hour?"
485;2233870;2239730;"- Oh, yeah! Maybe I can see the comet! - Huh? The comet?"
486;2240320;2243490;"Oh, Mitsuha..."
487;2243490;2246990;"you're dreaming right now, aren't you?"
488;2258050;2260950;"I'm crying? But why?"
490;2266130;2269820;"Ms. Okudera? She's almost where?"
491;2271150;2274160;"Oh, Mitsuha. What did you do?"
492;2274390;2275480;"Date?!"
495;2290480;2294020;"Well, that's what I had planned, but..."
496;2307260;2309790;"- Hi, Taki. - Huh? Agh!"
497;2310610;2315620;"- Wait long? - Yeah. Aah-no! Uh..."
498;2323860;2328110;"- I just got here. - Thank goodness. Let's go!"
499;2329690;2334090;"Must be nice. they've probably met up about now."
500;2337520;2339880;"Huh?"
501;2342230;2344740;"Why am I...?"
502;2345020;2347070;"Why...?"
503;2352400;2359700;"It was a date I wanted to go on, but if it so happens that you end up goin', you better be grateful and enjoy it!"
504;2360380;2367780;"This is nice! It's my first time here. so, is this one of your usual go-to spots?"
505;2364990;2370270;"Mitsuha: At any rate, I bet you've never even been on a single date."
506;2367780;2370270;"No way, it's too expensive!"
507;2371250;2373230;"I don't know what to say to her."
508;2373230;2377900;"That's why I've handpicked some links below to help you out, ya wallflower!"
509;2377900;2378940;"For real?"
512;2386230;2388370;"She's making fun of me!"
514;2417170;2418960;"You know something, Taki?"
515;2419530;2424230;"Today, you're... you're like a different person."
516;2432450;2437810;"Ms. Okudera. You getting hungry? we could get dinner."
517;2438090;2443630;"- Uh... let's call it a day. - U-uh... Alright."
518;2444060;2448470;"- I could be wrong, and I'm sorry if I am... - About?"
519;2448590;2452410;"But you used to have a little crush on me, am I right?"
520;2453710;2457070;"But right now, there's someone else you like, huh?"
521;2457130;2461760;"- N-n-no! U-uh-it's not that... - Really?"
522;2461760;2466190;"- There's no one. It's not like that. - Are you sure about that?"
523;2467340;2471040;"Well, thanks for today. See you at work!"
524;2485740;2487750;"Taki: By the time the date's over,"
526;2494020;2497710;"What does she mean? Weirdo."
527;2525090;2526130;"-Oh."
528;2526130;2527820;"Mitsuha: It's you, Teshi."
529;2528280;2532520;"No. I just didn't feel like goin', that's all. I'm fine."
530;2533490;2536610;"What? The festival?"
531;2536610;2538440;"Ah..."
532;2538440;2543250;"Oh yeah, the comet. It'll be at its brightest today, right?"
533;2543550;2546490;"Okay, got it. Seeya later!"
534;2550030;2553600;"You're just looking forward to seeing mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?"
535;2553600;2555340;"I- I am not!"
536;2555340;2557340;"I mean, it didn't even cross my mind."
537;2558380;2563730;"- Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her. - Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya."
538;2563730;2565120;"It's not funny!"
539;2565120;2567450;"- Sorry to keep ya. - Oh, she's here! - You're late!"
540;2570060;2574110;"- Mitsuha, what happened to-? - [Gasp]"
541;2574110;2576070;"-Your hair!"
542;2576070;2579200;"I guess... it's weird."
543;2587710;2591120;"You think it's gotta do with some guy. like, he broke her heart?"
544;2591120;2594480;"Guys always just assume that It has to do with a boy."
545;2594480;2601370;"- She said she felt like cuttin' it. - Ya sure about that? You really think she felt like cuttin' off that much of it?"
546;2601370;2604750;"Hey guys, I can see it!"
547;2621750;2625400;"- Whoa, ho-ho! - Whoa... - Ah."
548;2629370;2631590;"Huh?"
549;2642160;2647780;"Phone: The number you are trying to reach is currently outside the cellular network or has been turned off due-"
550;2650410;2655320;"Taki: I'll just have to tell her how lousy the date ended up the next time we switch."
551;2655320;2657630;"That's what I thought."
552;2657630;2660430;"But, for some reason,"
553;2660430;2664630;"the switches Mitsuha and I had been going through until now..."
554;2664630;2668400;"they never happened again."
557;2779270;2780560;"Wha-"
558;2780560;2781940;"What are-"
559;2781940;2784530;"What are you doing here?"
560;2786690;2789580;"Okudera: Tsukasa told me about it, so here I am."
561;2792790;2797900;"I asked for two things: to cover my shift and to back up my alibi if my dad asked."
562;2797900;2799980;"Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift."
563;2799980;2801400;"Takagi: Gotch'a covered!"
564;2801400;2803350;"But you owe me dinner."
565;2803510;2806600;"- So, you're all in on it... - You've got everyone worried about you."
566;2806600;2810700;"- Huh? - We can't ignore this! What if somebody's trying to pull one over on you?"
567;2810700;2811850;"Like catfish?"
568;2812030;2814330;"I mean, you met this person online, didn't you?"
569;2814330;2816800;"No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated."
570;2816800;2818860;"- Could be from a dating site- - She's NOT!"
571;2819540;2823610;"It's because you've been acting awfully fishy lately, so we're keeping an eye on you."
572;2823620;2825320;"I don't need a babysitter, okay!"
573;2827860;2832980;"Taki: The switches stopped, my calls never connected, and texts never went through."
574;2833160;2837690;"That's why I decided to go see Mitsuha in person."
575;2837690;2840680;"I wanted to see her, but..."
576;2842400;2847730;"-What? You don't know where she is exactly? the town's landscape is your only clue?"
577;2847900;2849740;"Yeah."
578;2851530;2855410;"And you can't contact her? what's that about?"
579;2855620;2858990;"-Where are we? you're a terrible tour guide- -'Cause I'm not one!"
580;2859530;2862570;"Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search."
581;2862570;2867230;"- Aww, it's so cute! Look, Taki! - Seriously, guys?"
582;2867230;2869600;"Okudera: It moved! Awww!"
583;2898310;2899410;"Taki: This is a lost cause."
584;2899410;2900530;"- What?! - What?!"
585;2900530;2903500;"After everything that we've done for you today?!"
586;2906010;2908650;"You haven't done anything!"
587;2911780;2914980;"- One Takayama Ramen. - One Takayama Ramen."
588;2914980;2916500;"I guess I'll have the same."
589;2916500;2917840;"Sure."
590;2917840;2920310;"Waitress: Three orders of ramen. chef: Got it."
591;2922200;2926410;"- Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight? - Well, I think we'll be cuttin' it close."
592;2926410;2927540;"Let me take a look."
593;2927540;2931180;"- K, thanks. - Wait, Taki. You sure about that?"
594;2932980;2938030;"Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been barking up the wrong tree this whole time."
595;2942020;2945190;"Hey, that's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?"
596;2946830;2948690;"It's drawn really well."
597;2948690;2951070;"Come take a look at this, hon!"
598;2951860;2955040;"Yeah, that's Itomori. Takes me back."
599;2955040;2957630;"My husband was born and raised there, you know."
600;2957820;2959970;"Itomori?"
601;2961050;2965630;"Yes, of course! That's the place! It's nearby, right?"
602;2965780;2967140;"You don't...?"
603;2967140;2969050;"Itomori was..."
604;2969050;2970990;"Itomori...[Gasp]"
605;2970990;2974640;"- But that's where-! - Wait! Isn't that the area where that comet-?"
606;2975220;2976840;"Huh?"
608;3024000;3025150;"Hey..."
609;3025150;3027280;"Okudera: Is this place really where she's from?"
610;3027280;3031190;"Tsukasa: No way. Taki must have just confused this with somewhere else."
611;3031190;3033300;"Taki: No, I didn't."
612;3033300;3035420;"This was the place."
613;3035420;3037730;"The schoolyard, these mountains,"
614;3037730;3039230;"even this high school here!"
615;3039230;3040790;"I remember it all!"
616;3040790;3042740;"There's no way you could."
617;3042740;3046550;"You've gotta know about that Disaster three years ago, right?"
618;3046750;3051050;"- Hundreds of people died. - They died..."
619;3051050;3053100;"three years ago?"
620;3053100;3055920;"It can't be..."
621;3056120;3057940;"There's no way..."
622;3057940;3059570;"I mean..."
623;3059570;3062250;"I still have the memos she wrote."
624;3079140;3082840;"They're fading."
625;3090830;3095610;"Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period of 1,200 years,"
627;3095610;3099780;"made a close approach to Earth three years ago in October."
629;3099780;3103850;"Nobody foresaw that its nucleus would split at its perigee."
633;3109790;3114460;"A fragment that broke off of it became a meteor and struck Japan."
635;3115710;3119960;"It looks like that day was the same date as the Autumn Festival."
636;3120120;3122490;"The point of impact was here."
637;3122950;3127890;"At 8:42 PM (20:42), it fell right around where people were gathered for the festival."
639;3132070;3134300;"Over 500 died."
640;3134300;3136880;"It was a third of the town's population,"
641;3136880;3138880;"and now, nobody lives in Itomori anymore."
642;3148170;3150200;"Teshigawara..."
643;3150200;3151690;"and Sayaka."
645;3156540;3157710;"That's her?!"
646;3157710;3159940;"You were wrong! You gotta be!"
647;3159940;3163700;"After all, this girl here died three years ago!"
648;3163700;3168420;"Just... two or three weeks ago, she said that I'd be able to see the comet."
649;3168950;3170670;"That means-!"
650;3170670;3175920;"- "You're dreaming right now... aren't you?" - I..."
651;3176440;3179640;"I..."
652;3179640;3180640;"What..."
653;3180640;3181370;"was I?"
654;3195100;3196970;"Sounds lively over there."
655;3196970;3199970;"They only have one room left. I'm really sorry."
656;3199970;3201880;"It's not a problem."
657;3202340;3203600;"How's Taki?"
658;3203600;3206210;"He's still reading articles on Itomori."
659;3206210;3210890;"He's goin' through all those newspapers and magazines at random. Seems obsessive."
660;3215290;3218380;"- What is it? - Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?"
661;3218690;3222070;"Yeah. I did quit at one point."
662;3223020;3226100;"What do you think about what Taki's been saying?"
663;3228820;3231550;"I had feelings for him, y'know."
664;3231550;3233780;"The way he's been recently."
665;3233780;3237750;"I mean, he was a nice guy before, but he's even nicer now."
666;3238370;3240770;"Kind-of... frantic."
667;3240770;3242800;"It was cute."
668;3242800;3247480;"Although, I do think what he's been telling us is definitely strange-sounding."
669;3249250;3255440;"But in the end, the fact remains that Taki's met someone, and that someone is the reason he changed."
670;3255840;3259700;"That much is for sure."
672;3273220;3275720;"It was all just a dream."
673;3276590;3278590;"I recognized the landscape"
674;3278590;3283110;"because I unconsciously remembered the news from three years ago."
675;3283960;3286870;"If it's not that, is she... a ghost?"
676;3287260;3288890;"Or..."
677;3288890;3290780;"did I just make it up?"
678;3290780;3292440;"The whole thing?"
679;3295770;3298300;"What was her name?"
680;3298300;3300300;"I can't remember."
681;3302020;3304630;"Tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath."
682;3304700;3306420;"Ms. Okudera,"
683;3306420;3307530;"Uh..."
684;3307530;3309080;"I, um..."
685;3309080;3312590;"I realize I've been saying a lot of strange things."
686;3312590;3315100;"I'm really sorry, and thank you."
689;3323360;3325810;"Braided cords. Pretty."
690;3326530;3328540;"That band on your wrist."
691;3328540;3331490;"- That's one, isn't it? - Hm? Oh."
692;3331490;3333230;"This thing? Guess so."
693;3333230;3334620;"Somebody..."
694;3334620;3337000;"Someone gave it to me."
695;3337000;3340470;"I wear it sometimes as... Kind-of a lucky charm."
696;3342580;3344030;"Who was it?"
697;3346150;3351970;"- It's late. Why don't you go Down and take a bath, too? - Sure-wait."
698;3354300;3357100;"Yeah. Someone who makes these,"
699;3357100;3359100;"they once told me something."
700;3359100;3362100;"The cords represent the flow of time."
701;3362100;3363870;"They twist and tangle,"
702;3363870;3365680;"unravel and connect,"
703;3365680;3368710;"and that's what time is."
704;3370320;3371690;"Maybe if I could-"
706;3397820;3399720;"Taki..."
707;3399730;3401700;"Distant Voice: Taki."
708;3401700;3404710;"Taki!"
709;3404710;3406620;"Don't you remember?!"
711;3429110;3430110;"Taki..."
712;3454560;3456730;"Eat this bento up there."
713;3457720;3461990;"Your drawing of Itomori. you did a real good job."
714;3499370;3501860;"-They assemble and take shape,"
715;3501860;3503600;"they twist, tangle,"
716;3503600;3505280;"unravel now and then,"
717;3505280;3506050;"break,"
718;3506050;3507980;"and reconnect."
719;3508610;3510490;"That's what a union is."
720;3510490;3512920;"What time is."
721;3523910;3526370;"There it is."
722;3527400;3528990;"It's really there!"
723;3529940;3531080;"It wasn't..."
724;3531080;3533380;"a dream."
725;3563410;3566990;"What lies ahead is the netherworld."
726;3589470;3591690;"It's still here."
727;3592800;3597380;"This was Yotsuha's, and this was mine."
728;3599410;3601270;"This was before the comet."
729;3601780;3603980;"So when I switched places with her,"
730;3604300;3607010;"it was also three years in the past."
731;3608250;3612020;"Our times... got tangled somehow."
732;3612750;3615580;"This is... half of her."
733;3629850;3630970;"Musubi,"
734;3632220;3636020;"if it's true, and time can be unraveled,"
735;3636020;3639070;"just give me one more chance."
736;3649290;3650940;"Agh!"
737;3652780;3655000;"A comet!"
738;3661030;3664030;"ngh! Hh..."
739;3716790;3720930;"- [Crying] - Your name's going to be..."
740;3720930;3722180;"Mitsuha."
741;3728670;3731040;"Both of you are my treasures."
742;3731040;3734140;"You're going to be a big sister!"
744;3736060;3740310;"I'm so sorry, my dears..."
745;3740770;3743980;"Dad, when is mommy coming home?"
746;3744760;3748080;"- I couldn't help her! - Get ahold of yourself!"
747;3748080;3751350;"- Who cares about the shrine?! - But you're in charge now!"
748;3751350;3755260;"- I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine! - Get out!"
749;3758550;3760540;"Now listen to me, girls."
750;3760540;3764980;"Starting today, you'll be living with grandma."
752;3769220;3771800;"Who are you?"
755;3771800;3773290;"Don't be full of yourself!"
756;3773290;3775380;"Like you have a girlfriend!"
757;3775380;3776800;"Must be nice."
758;3776800;3779310;"They've probably met up about now."
759;3780480;3781830;"Why am I...?"
760;3781830;3786090;"- I'm going to Tokyo. - What?! Wait, Sis!"
761;3787540;3789050;"Grandma?"
762;3789050;3792080;"Would you mind doing me a favor?"
763;3792080;3795100;"Oh yeah, the comet."
764;3795100;3798170;"It'll be at its brightest today, right?"
765;3798170;3800570;"-Mitsuha, don't go there!"
766;3801230;3802620;"Mitsuha!"
767;3802620;3806070;"You've gotta get out of town before the comet strikes!"
768;3808160;3810600;"Mitsuha, run!"
769;3810660;3817340;"Mitsuha! Mitsuha! Mitsuha!"
770;3833860;3835350;"Taki (as Mitsuha): Mitsuha."
771;3835350;3837980;"She's alive!"
772;3847510;3849580;"Let me guess, you're touching your boo-"
773;3850930;3854770;"[Crying] Her sister!"
774;3856140;3858330;"Yotsuha!"
775;3858330;3859350;"Yotsuha: Ungh!"
776;3861670;3864170;"I think she's finally lost it."
777;3864170;3867540;"Just for today, I-I'm gonna head out first..."
778;3867540;3868860;"She's lost it..."
779;3868860;3870070;"Really lost it..."
780;3870070;3871410;"Totally!"
781;3871410;3872660;"Totally..."
782;3872660;3878410;"-For all you stargazers out there, the comet Tiamat has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now."
783;3878410;3884770;"Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 PM (19:40), and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's..."
784;3884770;3887730;"It's tonight! There's still time left!"
785;3888160;3890220;"Mornin', Mitsuha!"
786;3890220;3892510;"What's this?"
787;3892510;3893850;"Hold on..."
788;3893850;3897690;"- You're not Mitsuha, are you? - W-wait, how did you-?"
789;3898120;3900170;"You already knew?"
790;3900170;3907200;"No, but watching the way you've been behaving lately stirred some memories up."
791;3907550;3909890;"When I was a young girl,"
792;3909890;3913010;"I had some pretty strange dreams myself."
793;3913010;3913810;"Huh?"
794;3913810;3920710;"Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became In those dreams have pretty much faded at this point."
795;3920710;3921940;"Faded?"
796;3921960;3927230;"Treasure the experience. Dreams eventually will fade away."
797;3927230;3930050;"I went through similar times myself,"
798;3930050;3932700;"and so did your mother."
799;3933200;3934310;"What if..."
800;3934310;3936960;"all those dreams that the Miyamizu people had!"
801;3936960;3939300;"It had to do with today!"
802;3939950;3942720;"Grandma, you have to listen to me!"
803;3943040;3944490;"Tonight,"
804;3944490;3946800;"the comet is going to fall on Itomori!"
805;3946800;3949190;"- You're all gonna die! - Huh?"
806;3955390;3957390;"Nobody's gonna believe that?"
807;3957390;3960340;"I didn't expect that out of Mitsuha's grandma."
808;3960340;3964270;"It doesn't matter! there's no way I'm gonna let them all die!"
809;3964820;3966280;"Mitsuha!"
810;3966280;3967820;"What happened... to-?"
811;3969150;3970550;"What'd you-?"
812;3970550;3971520;"Your hair!"
813;3971520;3976000;"-Ugh, the haircut? looked better before, huh? -No, i-i-it's good!"
814;3976000;3980690;"Nevermind that! If we don't do something about tonight, we'll all die!"
815;3982410;3985400;"It's up to us to save everyone!"
816;3989350;3991410;"Wait, shouldn't you be in school?"
817;3991410;3996120;"Well, we sort-of have to save the town, or something."
818;3996120;3997120;"Heh?"
819;3997820;4001380;"- The warning system? - Yeah, those speakers all over the town."
821;4005400;4008280;"I get it. It could work!"
822;4008280;4012540;"- Niiiice job, Teshi. - Hey, I don't think you should be sittin' so close to me."
823;4012540;4016150;"- What's wrong. Uh-oh! You shyyy? - Would you quit it?!"
824;4016150;4018400;"It ain't proper and you know it!"
826;4019680;4021830;"Taki (as Mitsuha): T-hahahahaha!"
827;4021830;4025130;"Such a gentleman."
828;4026060;4028000;"I bought all the snacks, guys."
829;4028000;4030470;"- Here's the change. - Sorry for the trouble."
830;4030470;4031470;"I didn't mind."
831;4031590;4034660;"- We oughta be gettin' paid. - Quit complaining."
832;4035500;4037670;"So? Wha'dcha come up with?"
833;4037670;4040080;"Got an evacuation plan?"
834;4043090;4044610;"A- A-"
835;4044610;4046020;"A BOMB?!"
836;4046020;4050370;"Yeah, we have water gel explosives we use for construction at our storage site."
837;4050370;4053010;"AND the warning system?"
838;4053360;4057150;"Our startup frequency can hijack the town's warning system pretty easily,"
839;4057150;4061340;"so we can broadcast an evacuation warning for the whole town right from school!"
840;4061380;4063690;"Look, we're outside the disaster area here,"
841;4063690;4066460;"so we'll just make an announcement to evacuate to the school."
842;4066460;4067770;"It's-"
843;4067770;4070970;"- It's totally a crime! - You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya."
844;4070970;4073460;"- Why me?! - You're in the Broadcast Club."
845;4073590;4077250;"- And I'll be in charge of the explosives. - While I go have a word with the mayor."
846;4077250;4082140;"- Why? - 'Cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from Town Hall, then nobody's gonna go anyway."
847;4082140;4085470;"But if I talk to the mayor, as his daughter, I can convince him."
848;4085470;4088120;"It's the perfect plan!"
849;4088700;4091300;"Fine, I don't really care one way or the other."
850;4091300;4094190;"This is just a theory of yours, right?"
851;4094800;4095810;"Well..."
852;4095810;4101590;"Theories can be based on reality. Like, do you know the story of how Itomori Lake was formed? It's a crater!"
854;4101590;4108090;"- That means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago! - Right. That's why-!"
855;4108090;4109890;"Nice one, Teshi!"
856;4113620;4115520;"- Let's go evacuate the town!"
857;4119700;4122710;"Mitsuha's Father: What on earth are you talking about?!"
858;4123720;4125040;"Like I said,"
859;4125040;4130000;"-We have to evacuate everyone In town before tonight or else- -Enough! Shut up!"
860;4134580;4138470;"The comet's going to split In two and strike the town?"
862;4138470;4141140;"Over 500 will die?"
863;4141140;4144620;"How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!"
864;4145110;4148030;"If you're serious, you must be sick!"
865;4148030;4152000;"I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait."
866;4152820;4156450;"I'll have a car take you to the city hospital for an examination."
867;4156450;4160380;"We will continue this discussion after you've seen a doctor."
868;4161820;4163880;"You!"
869;4164570;4168010;"You son of a- !"
870;4174440;4176000;"Mitsuha's Father: Mitsuha..."
871;4177020;4178390;"No..."
872;4178970;4180410;"Wait a minute..."
873;4181520;4183590;"Who are you?"
874;4198000;4201950;"-I'll see you guys at the festival, ba-bye! -We'll meet ya at the step stone shrine. Don't be late, k?"
875;4201950;4204910;"- Ba-bye! - Seeya! - Later!"
876;4206030;4207710;"You shouldn't go!"
877;4207710;4211880;"-You've got to leave town! tell all of your friends! -What's wrong with you?!"
878;4211880;4215300;"- Mitsuha! - What was that about? - Come on, let's go."
879;4215300;4217700;"What are you doing, huh?"
880;4218060;4220030;"If it was Mitsuha,"
881;4220030;4222320;"would she have been able to convince him?"
882;4222320;4224190;"- Is all this my fault?! - Huh?!"
883;4224190;4227930;"Yotsuha, promise me that you'll leave town with grandma before dark!"
884;4227930;4228570;"What?!"
885;4228570;4231670;"- You're gonna die if you stay here! - What are you talking about?!"
886;4231670;4237530;"And why did you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?! you've been acting really strange lately!"
887;4238300;4242750;"- Went to Tokyo? - Hey! Mitsuha!"
888;4244700;4246960;"How'd it go with your old man?"
889;4248810;4251250;"Hey, Mitsuha!"
890;4251250;4252900;"What's with your sister?"
891;4252900;4255280;"Don't know."
892;4264070;4266410;"Could she be over there?"
893;4266580;4268890;"What's that? What's over there?"
894;4269210;4272030;"- Let me use your bike, Teshi. - Hey."
895;4272030;4274040;"Mitsuha."
896;4274350;4276060;"And what do we do?"
897;4276060;4278200;"Get things ready like we planned!"
898;4278200;4280930;"I'm counting on you!"
899;4306360;4309010;"Mitsuha: Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again!"
900;4312090;4314630;"What's Taki doin' out here?"
901;4323710;4325480;"The town!"
902;4325480;4327370;"It's gone!"
903;4336780;4338000;"So..."
904;4338540;4340000;"does that mean..."
905;4342350;4344910;"I... died?!"
906;4354800;4356710;"Taki."
907;4356710;4359020;"Taki!"
908;4360140;4361800;"Don't you remember?!"
909;4374520;4376550;"I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours."
910;4376550;4378370;"Wha? Right now?"
911;4378370;4379800;"- But why? - Uh..."
912;4379800;4381210;"For a date."
913;4381210;4385320;"- You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?! - I-I didn't say it was a date for me."
914;4386730;4389000;"I'll be back tonight."
915;4391440;4397000;"Mitsuha: If I suddenly show up, will it be a nuisance or a surprise?"
916;4397000;4400000;"He might not like it if I do."
917;4407060;4411370;"The number you are trying to reach Is currently outside the cellular network."
918;4411370;4414620;"I guess it won't happen, but..."
919;4414620;4416640;"What if it did?"
920;4416640;4418590;"What would I do?"
921;4418590;4420640;"Would I annoy him?"
923;4420640;4424750;"Would it be awkward, or maybe..."
924;4424750;4427990;"he'd be glad to see me."
925;4428300;4432590;"The number you are trying to reach Is currently outside the cellular network."
926;4433350;4435870;"I guess we won't meet."
927;4436970;4441860;"But... there's one thing I'm certain of."
928;4442330;4444520;"If we see each other,"
929;4444520;4447320;"We'll definitely know right away..."
930;4447840;4451530;"that you were the one who was in me,"
931;4451530;4454800;"and that I was the one who was in..."
932;4454800;4456550;"- you. - Sorry!"
933;4487860;4490000;"'Scuse me."
934;4509740;4512000;"Taki: Agh!"
935;4521410;4522630;"That time..."
936;4522630;4524230;"three years ago."
937;4524230;4526290;"Before I even knew you..."
938;4529490;4531830;"Mitsuha: [Whispering] Taki..."
939;4531830;4534800;"Taki?"
940;4534800;4537010;"- Taki! - Huh?"
941;4537130;4540000;"Uh... It's me!"
942;4541710;4544410;"- Don't you... remember? - Uh..."
943;4545110;4548010;"Sorry, who are you?"
944;4551610;4553470;"I- I'm sorry."
945;4556690;4558000;"Ah!"
946;4560740;4563000;"Mitsuha: But, he's Taki!"
947;4563750;4564960;"Taki: What a weird girl."
948;4565190;4569070;"Train announcer: Yotsuya. Yotsuya. stay clear of the doors."
949;4574110;4575620;"- Hold on! - Huh?"
950;4575870;4577620;"- Egh! - What's your name?"
951;4578410;4580100;"Mitsuha!"
952;4580100;4581360;"My name is..."
953;4581360;4583480;"Mitsuha!"
954;4588980;4591230;"Taki (as Mitsuha): Three years ago..."
955;4591230;4593230;"you showed up."
956;4593230;4597010;"It was... to see me!"
957;4607590;4609940;"Mitsuha (as Taki): Taki."
958;4617500;4620360;"[Echoing] Mitsuha!"
959;4620360;4622690;"Taki?"
960;4636290;4638340;"Mitsuha!"
961;4638340;4640500;"You're here, right?"
962;4640500;4642520;"Inside my body?"
963;4642520;4644730;"Taki?!"
964;4644730;4647080;"Taki, where are you?!"
965;4647080;4649250;"Taki (as Mitsuha): That was Mitsuha."
966;4649250;4651140;"I can hear her voice, but..."
967;4652090;4654850;"Taki, where are you?"
968;4655250;4657200;"Taki!!"
969;4661930;4662940;"- Uh! - Huh?"
970;4669640;4674890;"Mitsuha (as Taki): Taki, are you...? taki (as Mitsuha)i: Are you there?"
971;4699840;4701050;"- Magic hour. - Magic hour."
972;4703730;4705020;"Uh..."
973;4715890;4716910;"Taki: Mitsuha."
974;4723600;4724850;"Mitsuha: Taki."
975;4725760;4727000;"Taki!"
976;4727570;4729730;"[Sobbing] You're really here!"
977;4733930;4737080;"- Taki! - I came all this way to see you,"
978;4737260;4739150;"which wasn't easy..."
979;4739150;4741630;"since you were pretty far away."
980;4742750;4744560;"How is that even...?"
981;4744560;4746210;"Because, back then!"
982;4746210;4749400;"Well, I drank some of your kuchikamizake."
983;4749440;4751370;"Huh?"
984;4751370;4753050;"Oh..."
985;4753050;4755210;"You... you drank that?!"
986;4755210;4755940;"Huh?"
987;4755940;4758240;"- STUPID PERVERT! - Wha-WHA?!"
988;4758240;4761250;"Mitsuha: Yeah, that's right! You were touching my boobies, WEREN'T YOU?!"
989;4761250;4762120;"Taki: WHA- ?!"
990;4762120;4764950;"- Wha-ho-how do you even- ?! - 'Cause Yotsuha saw you!"
991;4764950;4767440;"I just-I couldn't help myself!"
992;4767440;4770680;"- But it was just the one time! - Just the one time?"
993;4772820;4775350;"How many times is it the issue?!"
994;4775350;4776740;"Sorry!"
995;4776740;4777940;"Wait..."
996;4777940;4779040;"Is that...?"
997;4779510;4780220;"Oh."
998;4780220;4783700;"Yeah, it's yours, but you visited before I knew you."
999;4783700;4785980;"So, I didn't know who you were."
1000;4786380;4787910;"Here."
1001;4787910;4790300;"I kept it for three years,"
1002;4790300;4794000;"but I think it's time you got it back."
1003;4802770;4805530;"- Whaddya think? - Oh, uh, well..."
1004;4805530;4810100;"- it's not bad. - Oh, you're lyin'!"
1005;4810100;4810810;"Busted!"
1006;4810810;4813390;"Why you gotta be like that?"
1007;4827380;4829120;"Hey, Mitsuha."
1008;4829120;4831200;"You still have a lot to do."
1009;4831200;4832760;"Listen."
1010;4832760;4835410;"- It's coming. - Don't worry."
1011;4835410;4837760;"- You still have enough time. - [Nod]"
1012;4837760;4839700;"I'll do my best."
1013;4840620;4843410;"It looks like magic hour is almost..."
1014;4843410;4845010;"over."
1015;4846750;4848270;"Hey, Mitsuha."
1016;4848270;4851560;"Just so we don't forget things when we wake up..."
1017;4855280;4857990;"Let's write down our names."
1018;4857990;4860150;"Here."
1019;4870920;4872970;"Mitsuha."
1020;4874770;4876120;"Hey."
1021;4876120;4878120;"Mitsuha?"
1022;4885550;4887990;"I was planning to tell you..."
1023;4888810;4890890;"that wherever you are in the world,"
1024;4890890;4895020;"I swear that I'll find you again, no matter what."
1025;4897480;4898560;"Your name..."
1026;4898560;4900550;"is Mitsuha."
1027;4901130;4902360;"It'll be okay!"
1028;4902360;4903920;"I'll remember!"
1029;4903920;4904660;"Mitsuha."
1030;4904820;4905620;"Mitsuha."
1031;4905620;4906610;"Mitsuha!"
1032;4906610;4908040;"Your name is Mitsuha!"
1033;4908040;4909310;"Your name is-!"
1034;4920530;4922040;"Who..."
1035;4922040;4924040;"are you?"
1036;4925090;4926180;"And what..."
1037;4926180;4928930;"did I even come here for?"
1038;4928930;4929910;"I came..."
1039;4929910;4932180;"I came all this way to see her!"
1040;4932180;4933930;"I came to save her!"
1041;4933930;4936110;"I wanted her to be alive!"
1042;4936110;4937610;"Who was it again?"
1043;4937610;4938640;"Who?"
1044;4938640;4940590;"Who did I come to see?"
1045;4940590;4942170;"Someone precious!"
1046;4942170;4944600;"Someone I don't wanna forget!"
1047;4944600;4946750;"Someone I shouldn't!"
1048;4946750;4948170;"Who was it?"
1049;4948170;4949750;"Who was it?!"
1050;4949750;4950640;"Who?!"
1051;4950890;4951890;"Who?!"
1052;4951890;4954730;"What's your name?!"
1053;4968440;4969730;"Mitsuha: Taki."
1054;4969730;4970810;"Taki."
1055;4970810;4972220;"Taki."
1056;4972220;4973470;"It'll be fine!"
1057;4973470;4974670;"I remember!"
1058;4974670;4976410;"I'll never forget!"
1059;4976410;4977470;"Taki."
1060;4977590;4978850;"Taki."
1061;4978850;4980140;"Your name is..."
1062;4980140;4982990;"Taki!"
1064;4996370;4997860;"Teshi!"
1065;4997860;4998860;"Mitsuha!"
1066;4999310;5002680;"- Where the heck have you been? - He said sorry for breakin' your bike."
1067;5002680;5004440;"Wha? Who did?"
1068;5004440;5006000;"I did!"
1069;5006580;5009530;"You're gonna have to Explain it to me later."
1070;5013320;5015310;"That thing is gonna fall, right?"
1071;5015310;5018500;"- For real? - For real. I saw it with my own eyes."
1072;5018500;5021310;"What? You did, huh?"
1073;5021310;5024040;"Well, I guess it's settled, then."
1074;5024040;5026460;"We're both officially criminals."
1076;5027890;5031260;"What?! Do I really have to...?!"
1077;5031260;5035360;"Once the town's power goes out, the emergency generator should kick in right away."
1078;5035360;5037540;"Use the broadcast equipment once it does."
1079;5037540;5040920;"Don't be scared, Saya! and repeat it as many times as you can!"
1080;5040920;5042300;"Woo-hoo!"
1081;5042300;5047250;"- You can do it! - Aw, nuts! It's do or die!"
1082;5053090;5056280;"- Shouldn't it be goin' off? - Hell if I know!"
1083;5064770;5066850;"- Oooh... - Ha ha!"
1084;5067110;5069020;"- What was that? - It was pretty loud, too."
1085;5069020;5070960;"Look over there!"
1086;5095350;5098990;"- Hey look, up there! - Whoa!"
1087;5106660;5110050;"This is Itomori Town Hall!"
1088;5110050;5115000;"- Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in! - An explosion? Did I hear that right?"
1089;5115000;5119560;"Wildfires are possible, as well as the threat of more explosions!"
1090;5119560;5125840;"Residents in the followin' areas, please Evacuate to Itomori High School immediately."
1091;5126320;5128550;"Kadoiri District."
1092;5128550;5131160;"- Sakagami District! - Honey, we should go."
1093;5131160;5134610;"The broadcast isn't coming from us? well, who the hell is it, then?"
1094;5134610;5136730;"Miyamori District."
1095;5137390;5139910;"Oyazawa District."
1096;5139990;5142180;"Let's go, Mitsuha!"
1097;5143600;5145010;"Teshi!"
1098;5151150;5156590;"- Everyone, run! There's a wildfire! - Wildfire, please run!"
1099;5156590;5161440;"- Get outta here! Run, there's a fire! - It's not safe here! Please, evacuate!"
1100;5161630;5164090;"It's not workin', we're runnin' out of time!"
1101;5164090;5166600;"- Mitsuha! - [Sobbing]"
1102;5166600;5168000;"What's wrong?"
1103;5168500;5170570;"What is it...?"
1104;5170570;5173980;"I can't remember what his name is anymore!"
1105;5175300;5179160;"What is with you?! you're the one who started all of this!"
1106;5179160;5182640;"We can't evacuate everyone without firefighters!"
1107;5182640;5185900;"Get goin'! You gotta convince your old man!"
1108;5193210;5197100;"Everybody, get to the high school! HURRY!"
1109;5199030;5200990;"Oh, it's Mitsuha."
1110;5203760;5208700;"-Why would terrorists attack way out here? what is Chubu Electric saying? -They're still checking."
1111;5208700;5211210;"Any update? No wildfires yet?"
1112;5211210;5213300;"You sure? Got it."
1113;5214460;5218440;"Make them stop this broadcast immediately! haven't you located its source yet?"
1114;5218440;5221390;"Mayor, the Takayama sensor station just called!"
1115;5222490;5224040;"From the high school?"
1116;5224180;5229780;"Once again, residents in the following areas, please evacuate to Itomori High..."
1117;5229780;5232660;"- Ah! - What are you doing?! Turn that off!"
1118;5235200;5237600;"- They got Saya! - Oh no."
1119;5240900;5243780;"What were you thinking, Natori?! I swear!"
1120;5247270;5250780;"This is Itomori Town Hall."
1121;5250780;5255310;"We are currently confirming the reports of the accident."
1122;5255490;5262180;"- We instruct all residents to remain calm and stay where they are until further notice. - I guess... we have to stay put?"
1123;5262430;5264700;"- What is goin' on? - So stay on standby."
1124;5265500;5270360;"Come on! They said everyone should evacuate! the high school's the evacuation center!"
1125;5270360;5272500;"-Katsuhiko!"
1126;5274760;5275740;"Tell me..."
1127;5275740;5278510;"What do you think you're doing?!"
1128;5280700;5282490;"Sorry, Mitsuha."
1129;5283480;5285440;"This is the end."
1130;5287020;5288520;"Oh, my God!"
1131;5288520;5291330;"It's actually splittin' apart!"
1132;5297710;5303890;"Look at that! The comet has split into two large Parts and meteors are now falling to Earth!"
1133;5304140;5308380;"- Uh, I don't believe anyone could have predicted this. - Either way, we have quite the mystical view here."
1134;5308380;5311870;"-So, what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us?"
1135;5311870;5317690;"-The comet's not within the Roche limit, so the nucleus Itself must've had a structural weakness for this to happen."
1136;5317690;5322520;"-Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart and collided with Jupiter in 1994."
1137;5323060;5325220;"- There were at least 21 fragments... - I'm going outside to take a look."
1138;5325220;5328650;"- The fragments will likely burn up well before reaching the ground. - Does it pose a danger?"
1139;5328650;5333020;"-Probability of a meteor actually landing on a populated area is quite small."
1140;5333020;5334650;"-never foresaw this development."
1141;5334650;5338770;"- To predict the trajectory... - As we stand here witnessing this spectacle,"
1142;5338770;5340270;"unassisted..."
1143;5340270;5341590;"and with our bare eyes,"
1144;5341590;5346970;"it strikes me that living in such an age has never felt more fortunate than now."
1145;5349580;5350700;"Mitsuha: Hey..."
1146;5351210;5352310;"Who..."
1147;5352310;5354000;"are you?"
1148;5356830;5358200;"Who?"
1149;5358560;5360240;"Who?"
1150;5360330;5362260;"Who is he?"
1151;5362260;5364030;"Someone precious."
1152;5364030;5366020;"Someone I shouldn't forget!"
1153;5366020;5368740;"Someone I didn't want to!"
1154;5368740;5370430;"Who?"
1155;5370430;5371510;"Who?!"
1156;5371510;5373410;"Who are you?!"
1157;5373410;5376150;"What's your name?!"
1158;5381010;5382460;"Oh no!"
1159;5382520;5383880;"Ah! Argh!"
1160;5387660;5388780;"Ungh!"
1161;5401840;5404410;"-So that we don't forget things when we wake up..."
1162;5404410;5406990;"Let's write down our names."
1164;5433580;5435160;"Writing this..."
1165;5435160;5436790;"doesn't help!"
1166;5436790;5439090;"I won't know your name..."
1167;5452080;5454280;"Dad!"
1168;5454830;5456900;"- Mitsuha. - There you are!"
1169;5456900;5459110;"Don't tell me you're back!"
1170;5459110;5461000;"Ah..."
1171;5463000;5466090;"-It was almost like seeing something out of a dream."
1172;5466510;5468340;"Nothing more or less..."
1173;5468340;5470700;"than a breathtaking view."
1174;5470700;5475110;"Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate","
1175;5475110;5478910;"no matter how far they extend their hands,"
1176;5478910;5482720;"we breathe, we dream, we raise our love"
1177;5482720;5486860;"in a timeless land that is far out of reach."
1178;5486860;5490530;"Even the second, hour hands of the clock."
1179;5490530;5494550;"They look at us sideways as they tick and tock."
1180;5494550;5499410;"How I hope to have forever to spend this life,"
1181;5499410;5501830;"no- all future lives"
1182;5501830;5509630;"right here in this world with you!"
1183;5562390;5563850;"Taki: Huh?"
1184;5564310;5565880;"Why am I here?"
1185;5567170;5569980;"What am I... doing?"
1186;5588570;5589680;"U-uh!"
1187;5594310;5598010;"Train Announcer: The doors are closing. Please be careful."
1188;5600600;5603400;"Taki: I'm always searching for something."
1189;5603400;5607030;"This... feeling has consumed me..."
1190;5607030;5608990;"for some time."
1191;5610290;5612350;"The reason I applied for this position-"
1192;5612350;5613890;"The landscapes people live in-"
1193;5613890;5615840;"To build a city's landscape-"
1194;5615840;5618800;"Even Tokyo. It might vanish too one day."
1195;5618800;5623210;"And so, I wanna make landscapes that- how should I put this?"
1196;5623210;5626700;"That can continue to warm peoples' hearts."
1197;5628340;5630650;"Takagi: That bad? How many does that make it?"
1198;5630650;5633400;"Taki: I've stopped counting. tsukasa: Doesn't sound too promising."
1199;5633400;5635990;"- Who asked you? - That suit could be the problem."
1200;5635990;5637760;"-It looks just like yours!"
1201;5637760;5641170;"- Well, I have two offers. - I have eight myself."
1203;5646290;5648380;"Taki: Is what I'm searching for..."
1204;5648380;5649880;"someone?"
1205;5649880;5651370;"Or somewhere?"
1206;5652110;5655390;"Or am I just searching for the right job?"
1207;5655390;5657320;"I don't even really know."
1208;5658030;5659220;"Oh!"
1209;5659220;5663100;"- You're job hunting, huh? - I haven't had much luck, though."
1210;5663100;5667950;"- Hey, maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances. - Uh-does it really look that bad on me?"
1211;5672250;5674850;"-So, why the sudden call today?"
1212;5674850;5680010;"-I was in the area for work and I figured It had been a while since I saw your face."
1214;5682130;5686070;"Okudera: Remember that one time when we went all the way to Itomori?"
1215;5686070;5689350;"You were still in high school back then, so it was..."
1216;5689350;5692580;"- Heh. Five years ago. - That long?"
1217;5693160;5694530;"It seems like..."
1218;5694530;5697130;"I've forgotten a lot."
1219;5697410;5699950;"Taki: I don't... remember all that much, Either."
1220;5699950;5701700;"About back then."
1221;5702090;5704200;"Maybe we argued."
1222;5704200;5707460;"She and Tsukasa went back to Tokyo without me."
1223;5707980;5711010;"I spent the night alone on some mountain."
1224;5711670;5713980;"That's about all I remember."
1225;5716340;5723330;"But, at one point in time, I found myself strangely Drawn to the incident involving that comet."
1226;5725500;5729000;"A fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster,"
1228;5729460;5731000;"but, miraculously,"
1229;5731000;5734210;"most of the people living In the town were unhurt."
1230;5734670;5738010;"The town happened to be holding an emergency drill that day,"
1233;5738020;5741380;"and most of its residents were outside the impact zone."
1236;5742610;5747600;"The sheer luck and coincidence of it all sparked various conspiracy theories."
1238;5748360;5751130;"I read a lot articles about it back then."
1240;5751130;5752990;"I was kind-of obsessed."
1241;5753640;5759000;"But whatever the reason I had for my Interest... is a mystery to me now."
1242;5760350;5763000;"I didn't even know anybody in that town."
1243;5766370;5769100;"Thanks for today. This is far enough."
1244;5770240;5772080;"I do hope,"
1245;5772080;5773980;"that at some point,"
1246;5773980;5776980;"you'll find happiness, too."
1247;5779760;5782690;"I feel like I'm always searching."
1248;5782690;5784430;"For something."
1249;5784430;5786020;"Someone."
1251;5797090;5800240;"I feel like I do wanna go to one more bridal fair."
1252;5800240;5801640;"They're all the same!"
1253;5801640;5806620;"- A Shinto weddin' sure sounds nice, too! - You said you wanted to be married in a chapel!"
1254;5806620;5808710;"- Oh, that reminds me, Teshi! - Uh!"
1255;5808690;5813380;"Would ya please shave before the ceremony? I'm goin' on a diet for it, you know."
1256;5813380;5815500;"She says as she's eatin' a cake!"
1257;5815500;5818710;"- I'll get serious tomorrow. - Uh..."
1263;5876440;5879650;"Taki: The landscape of a town that's no longer there."
1264;5879650;5883940;"Why does looking at it make my chest feel so tight?"
1265;5920490;5923020;"Now, just a little more,"
1266;5923020;5926200;"only just a little more."
1267;5926200;5932310;"Let's stay here a little longer now."
1268;5932310;5934490;"Just a little more,"
1269;5934490;5937730;"only just a little more."
1270;5937730;5942230;"Let's stick together Just a little bit longer."
1271;5943750;5945980;"Just a little more,"
1272;5945980;5949150;"only just a little more."
1273;5949150;5954340;"Let's stay here a little longer now."
1274;5954870;5957360;"Now just a little more,"
1275;5957360;5960510;"only just a little more."
1276;5960510;5963930;"Let's stick together Just a little bit longer."
1277;5963930;5968220;"Taki: I was always searching... mitsuha: Searching for..."
1278;5968220;5969370;"-someone!"
1279;5969370;5971630;"Oh yes, we are time fliers,"
1280;5971630;5974500;"scaling the walls of time. Climber"
1281;5974500;5979210;"tired of playing hide-and-seek with time and"
1282;5979210;5981330;"always comin' dead short."
1283;5981330;5983140;"I'll never let you go now,"
1284;5983140;5985630;"promise I will never let you go now,"
1285;5985630;5988340;"'cause my hand finally has reached yours!"
1286;5988340;5991010;"Why should I have to?"
1287;5992420;5994590;"Oh, you're sure quite a showy crier."
1288;5994590;5995950;"Wanna stop your tears,"
1289;5995950;5997440;"see your eyes drier."
1290;5997440;6000660;"But when I went to wipe your tears dry,"
1291;6000660;6004200;"you refused, but I saw them Pouring down your face, I knew why."
1292;6004200;6005900;"Crying even when you're happy,"
1293;6005900;6008530;"smiling even when you're feeling lonely."
1294;6008530;6010490;"It's because a part of you"
1295;6010490;6013410;"has made it here before the rest has."
1296;6027090;6028730;"Taki: Excuse me!"
1297;6028730;6030350;"Haven't we...?"
1298;6030350;6031250;"Have I..."
1299;6031250;6033970;"met you somewhere?"
1300;6041560;6043690;"Mitsuha: I thought so, too!"
1301;6047690;6049230;"- Can I ask you... - Can I ask you..."
1302;6049230;6050680;"- your name? - your name?"
1303;6051270;6057180;"The sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me,"
1304;6057180;6062920;"where did it find the loneliness It carried on the breeze?"
1305;6062920;6068680;"Looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears,"
1306;6068680;6074290;"I could see for miles of blue, It's never been so clear."
1307;6085630;6091430;"Speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair."
1308;6091430;6097050;"Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today."
1309;6097050;6102830;"Your ever kind heart, the way you smile, and even how you find your dreams."
1310;6102830;6108330;"I knew nothing, so honestly, I've always copied you."
1311;6108330;6110810;"Now, just a little more,"
1312;6110810;6114070;"only just a little more."
1313;6114070;6118690;"Let's stay here a little longer now."
1314;6119790;6122310;"Now just a little more,"

1316;6125510;6130100;"Let's stick together Just a little bit longer."
1317;6134190;6136510;"Oh yes, we are time fliers"
1318;6136510;6139390;"scaling the walls of time. Climber"
1319;6139390;6144080;"tired of playing hide-and-seek with time and"
1320;6144080;6146180;"always comin' dead short."
1321;6146180;6147870;"Crying even when you're happy,"
1322;6147870;6150500;"smiling even when you're feeling lonely."
1323;6150500;6155240;"It's because a part of you has made it here before the rest has."
1324;6177100;6182830;"I used to wish upon the stars, the toys that I once adored."
1325;6182830;6188780;"Forgotten now, are rollin' 'round the corners of the floor."
1326;6188780;6194390;"Finally, my dream has counted up to a hundred today."
1327;6194390;6200210;"Someday, I'll trade them all for just the very one."
1328;6205930;6211650;"Girl that I have seen in school, that never have told "hello","
1329;6211650;6217270;"After class today, I waved and said, “See you tomorrow!”"
1330;6217270;6222920;"It's not really that bad trying something new every once in a while,"
1331;6222920;6228420;"especially if I can do It with you by my side."
1332;6228420;6230950;"Now just a little more,"
1333;6230950;6234140;"only just a little more."
1334;6234140;6239020;"Let's stay here a little longer now."
1335;6240190;6242390;"Just a little more,"
1336;6242390;6245610;"only just a little more."
1337;6245610;6250000;"Let's stick together Just a little bit longer."
1338;6254310;6257750;"Oh yes, we are time fliers, so, and I..."
1339;6257750;6260630;"I knew who you were way before..."
1340;6260630;6263790;"way before I even knew my own name."
1341;6263790;6270270;"There's no clue, but I'm sure. I swear!"
1342;6272090;6274910;"Even if you're not around In this wide world,"
1343;6274910;6277740;"of course it surely would have some kind of meaning."
1344;6277740;6280650;"But if when you're not around in this crazy world,"
1345;6280650;6283710;"would be like the month of august without summer break."
1346;6283710;6286360;"And if you're not around In this great world,"
1347;6286360;6289610;"would be like Santa Claus without any glee."
1348;6289610;6297620;"If you're not around in this wide world!"
1349;6323010;6325190;"Oh yes, we are time fliers"
1350;6325190;6328130;"scaling the walls of time. Climber"
1351;6328130;6332820;"tired of playing hide-and-seek with time and"
1352;6332820;6334910;"always comin' dead short."
1353;6334910;6336690;"No, never mind that!"
1354;6336690;6339250;"No, never mind what I said now,"
1355;6339250;6342300;"'cause I'm on my way to you!"
1356;6343880;6346070;"Oh, we are time fliers,"
1357;6346070;6348920;"dashing up the steps of time now!"
1358;6348920;6353590;"No more playing hide-and-seek with you and time"
1359;6353590;6355670;"and always comin' dead short!"
1360;6355670;6357500;"You're quite a showy crier!"
1361;6357500;6358850;"Wanna stop your tears,"
1362;6358850;6360350;"see your eyes drier!"
1363;6360350;6363570;"But when I went to wipe your tears dry,"
1364;6363570;6367130;"you refused but I saw them pouring Down your face, I knew why!"
1365;6367130;6368820;"Crying even when I'm happy,"
1366;6368820;6371440;"smiling even when I'm feeling lonely!"
1367;6371440;6373430;"It's because the heart of mine"
1368;6373430;6377170;"has made it here before my body."

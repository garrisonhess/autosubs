some mornings i wake up crying without knowing why that's when everything happens now and again whatever that dream was i had i can never remember it but but the only thing that does last when i wake up is a sense of loss which lingers for a long time afterwards i'm always searching for something or someone i've been consumed by this feeling ever since that day the day a star fell it was almost like like seeing something out of a dream nothing more or less than a breathtaking view than a breathtaking view ah if only our voices speak at night could ever reach the very edge of this world and of time instead of fading into air and dust then what will the words could it ever be farthest words from probably let's make a promise that will never fade let's say it together on the count of three oh ah i'm told that some part of every wish will be heard but lately i've lost sight of the truth in those words i can't even remember when i gave up believing what could have been the reason ah the very moment that the rain will stop in the place rainbow born and dies and where the end of this life lies i've always been insisting there was something that i've longing for one day we'll reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented we'll high five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time the five dimensions keeps on teasing me but i will keep on looking at you dear let's make a sign for when we say nice to meet you again i'm on my way to you chasing after your name taki taki taki don't you remember my name is mitsuha sis what are you doing whoa they're so realistic feeling sis me

really  that we're in our dreams that guy and i  that we're in our dreams that girl and i  we're switching places we're switching places at last hello you've opened your eyes but why won't you even look me in the eyes what's wrong with you you angrily tell me that i'm late well i'm sorry but i did my best and running at my fastest pace i'm slowly beginning to realize what's going on taki's in high school and living in tokyo two or three times a week i'll suddenly and randomly switch with mitsuha who's somewhere out in the boonies the trigger is sleep the cause is unknown any memories i have of the switch get more and more hazy after i wake up but there's no doubt that we're switching places the reactions of everyone around us prove it and that's why that's why we decided to lay out some ground rules so we could protect each other's way of life things to watch out for during the switches and a list of stuff we should never do we also agreed to leave each other reports on our phones on the days we switch places so that we can work together to get through this weird thing that's happening and yet and yet i cannot believe this guy i cannot believe this girl back in the zenzenzense 'til this day been looking everywhere for you i followed the sound of your innocent laughter and it guided me in the right way even if every piece of you disappeared and if it scattered everywhere guys will stare watch the skirt these are basics for a girl it's goin' in your body plus i also worked for that money braiding cords is impossible 'cause you keep wasting money i wonder if we can push our way through the countless barrier that's waiting in the future just beyond our view side by side no way we can lose we'll beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules had tea with ms okudera on the way home you two have a good thing going quit messing with my relationships mitsuha hey taki why is a girl confessing her love to me maybe you're just more popular when i'm you you're so full of yourself like you have a girlfriend it's not like you have anyone either i don't i don't because i don't want a relationship because i don't want a relationship i shouldn't for her sake you sure do like your own boobies time to go get ready over the course of the last few days the tiamat comet has been visible but when and where can people see it from east to west from our point of view why are you wearin' your uniform grandma why does our shrine god's relic have to be kept so far away 'cause of mayugoro i don't really know who's mayugoro what he's famous hop on grandma oh watch out careful mitsuha yotsuha do you know about musubi mu subi it's what we used to call the local guardian deity long ago and it means union this word has profound meaning tying strings together is a union connecting to people is a union and the flow of time is a union these are all part of the god's power the braided cords that we make are tied to that a skill from the god they represent the flow of time itself they assemble and take shape they twist tangle unravel now and then break and reconnect that's what a union is what time is have a drink thanks i want some too that's also a union whether it's water rice or sake when something becomes a part of a person it's a union it joins their soul which is why the offering we're making today is such an important custom it connects the god with people hey i can see it this is where it is the sacred relic of miyamizu shrine what lies ahead is the hereafter it's the netherworld the netherworld in order to return to this world you have to leave behind what is most important to you like the kuchikamizake kuchikamizake you'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic after all it is half of you half of mitsuha wow it's already magic hour magic hour oh yeah maybe i can see the comet huh the comet oh mitsuha you're dreaming right now aren't you i'm crying but why ms okudera she's almost where oh mitsuha what did you do date well that's what i had planned but hi taki huh agh wait long yeah aah no uh i just got here thank goodness let's go must be nice they've probably met up about now huh why am i why it was a date i wanted to go on but if it so happens that you end up goin' you better be grateful and enjoy it this is nice it's my first time here so is this one of your usual go to spots at any rate i bet you've never even been on a single date no way it's too expensive i don't know what to say to her that's why i've handpicked some links below to help you out ya wallflower for real she's making fun of me you know something taki today you're you're like a different person ms okudera you getting hungry we could get dinner uh let's call it a day u uh alright i could be wrong and i'm sorry if i am about but you used to have a little crush on me am i right but right now there's someone else you like huh n n no u uh it's not that really there's no one it's not like that are you sure about that well thanks for today see you at work by the time the date's over what does she mean weirdo oh it's you teshi no i just didn't feel like goin' that's all i'm fine what the festival ah oh yeah the comet it'll be at its brightest today right okay got it seeya later you're just looking forward to seeing mitsuha in a yukata aren'tcha i i am not i mean it didn't even cross my mind y'know she sounded kinda down when i talked to her maybe she just didn't want a call from ya it's not funny sorry to keep ya oh she's here you're late mitsuha what happened to   your hair i guess it's weird you think it's gotta do with some guy like he broke her heart guys always just assume that it has to do with a boy she said she felt like cuttin' it ya sure about that you really think she felt like cuttin' off that much of it hey guys i can see it whoa ho ho whoa ah huh the number you are trying to reach is currently outside the cellular network or has been turned off due  i'll just have to tell her how lousy the date ended up the next time we switch that's what i thought but for some reason the switches mitsuha and i had been going through until now they never happened again wha  what are  what are you doing here tsukasa told me about it so here i am to cover my shift and to back up my alibi if my dad asked relax takagi's gonna take your shift gotch'a covered but you owe me dinner so you're all in on it you've got everyone worried about you huh we can't ignore this what if somebody's trying to pull one over on you like catfish i mean you met this person online didn't you no not exactly it's kinda complicated could be from a dating site she's not it's because you've been acting awfully fishy lately so we're keeping an eye on you i don't need a babysitter okay the switches stopped my calls never connected and texts never went through that's why i decided to go see mitsuha in person i wanted to see her but what you don't know where she is exactly the town's landscape is your only clue yeah and you can't contact her what's that about where are we you're a terrible tour guide 'cause i'm not one oh well guess we'll help you search aww it's so cute look taki seriously guys it moved awww this is a lost cause what what after everything that we've done for you today you haven't done anything one takayama ramen one takayama ramen i guess i'll have the same sure got it think we can make it back to tokyo tonight well i think we'll be cuttin' it close let me take a look k thanks wait taki you sure about that yeah i kinda feel like maybe i've been barking up the wrong tree this whole time hey that's a sketch of itomori isn't it it's drawn really well come take a look at this hon yeah that's itomori takes me back my husband was born and raised there you know itomori yes of course that's the place it's nearby right you don't itomori was itomori  but that's where wait isn't that the area where that comet  huh hey is this place really where she's from no way taki must have just confused this with somewhere else no i didn't this was the place the schoolyard these mountains even this high school here i remember it all there's no way you could you've gotta know about that disaster three years ago right hundreds of people died they died three years ago it can't be there's no way i mean i still have the memos she wrote they're fading comet tiamat with an orbital period of twelve hundred years made a close approach to earth three years ago in october nobody foresaw that its nucleus would split at its perigee a fragment that broke off of it became a meteor and struck japan it looks like that day was the same date as the autumn festival the point of impact was here at eight fourty two pm it fell right around where people were gathered for the festival over five hundred died it was a third of the town's population and now nobody lives in itomori anymore teshigawara and sayaka that's her you were wrong you gotta be after all this girl here died three years ago just two or three weeks ago she said that i'd be able to see the comet that means  you're dreaming right now aren't you i i what was i sounds lively over there they only have one room left i'm really sorry it's not a problem how's taki he's still reading articles on itomori he's goin' through all those newspapers and magazines at random seems obsessive what is it oh sorry you smoke huh yeah i did quit at one point what do you think about what taki's been saying i had feelings for him y'know the way he's been recently i mean he was a nice guy before but he's even nicer now kind of frantic it was cute although i do think what he's been telling us is definitely strange sounding but in the end the fact remains that taki's met someone and that someone is the reason he changed that much is for sure it was all just a dream i recognized the landscape because i unconsciously remembered the news from three years ago if it's not that is she a ghost or did i just make it up the whole thing what was her name i can't remember tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath ms okudera uh i um i realize i've been saying a lot of strange things i'm really sorry and thank you braided cords pretty that band on your wrist that's one isn't it hm oh this thing guess so somebody someone gave it to me i wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm who was it it's late why don't you go down and take a bath too sure wait yeah someone who makes these they once told me something the cords represent the flow of time they twist and tangle unravel and connect and that's what time is maybe if i could  taki taki taki don't you remember taki eat this bento up there your drawing of itomori you did a real good job they assemble and take shape they twist tangle unravel now and then break and reconnect that's what a union is what time is there it is it's really there it wasn't a dream what lies ahead is the netherworld it's still here this was yotsuha's and this was mine this was before the comet so when i switched places with her it was also three years in the past our times got tangled somehow this is half of her musubi if it's true and time can be unraveled just give me one more chance agh a comet ngh hh  your name's going to be mitsuha both of you are my treasures you're going to be a big sister i'm so sorry my dears dad when is mommy coming home i couldn't help her get ahold of yourself who cares about the shrine but you're in charge now i loved futaba not miyamizu shrine get out now listen to me girls starting today you'll be living with grandma who are you don't be full of yourself like you have a girlfriend must be nice they've probably met up about now why am i i'm going to tokyo what wait sis grandma would you mind doing me a favor oh yeah the comet it'll be at its brightest today right mitsuha don't go there mitsuha you've gotta get out of town before the comet strikes mitsuha run mitsuha mitsuha mitsuha mitsuha she's alive let me guess you're touching your boo   her sister yotsuha ungh i think she's finally lost it just for today i i'm gonna head out first she's lost it really lost it totally totally for all you stargazers out there the comet tiamat has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now tonight it will finally reach its perigee around seven fourty pm and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the earth's it's tonight there's still time left mornin' mitsuha what's this hold on you're not mitsuha are you w wait how did you  you already knew no but watching the way you've been behaving lately stirred some memories up when i was a young girl i had some pretty strange dreams myself huh though it's been so long the memories of who i became in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point faded treasure the experience dreams eventually will fade away i went through similar times myself and so did your mother what if all those dreams that the miyamizu people had it had to do with today grandma you have to listen to me tonight the comet is going to fall on itomori you're all gonna die huh nobody's gonna believe that i didn't expect that out of mitsuha's grandma it doesn't matter there's no way i'm gonna let them all die mitsuha what happened to  what'd you  your hair ugh the haircut looked better before huh no i i it's good nevermind that if we don't do something about tonight we'll all die it's up to us to save everyone wait shouldn't you be in school well we sort of have to save the town or something heh the warning system yeah those speakers all over the town i get it it could work niiiice job teshi hey i don't think you should be sittin' so close to me what's wrong uh oh you shyyy would you quit it it ain't proper and you know it t hahahahaha such a gentleman i bought all the snacks guys here's the change sorry for the trouble i didn't mind we oughta be gettin' paid quit complaining so wha'dcha come up with got an evacuation plan a a  a bomb yeah we have water gel explosives we use for construction at our storage site and the warning system our startup frequency can hijack the town's warning system pretty easily so we can broadcast an evacuation warning for the whole town right from school look we're outside the disaster area here so we'll just make an announcement to evacuate to the school it's  it's totally a crime you'll be in charge of the broadcast saya why me you're in the broadcast club and i'll be in charge of the explosives while i go have a word with the mayor why 'cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from town hall then nobody's gonna go anyway but if i talk to the mayor as his daughter i can convince him it's the perfect plan fine i don't really care one way or the other this is just a theory of yours right well theories can be based on reality like do you know the story of how itomori lake was formed it's a crater that means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago right that's why  nice one teshi let's go evacuate the town mitsuha' what on earth are you talking about like i said we have to evacuate everyone in town before tonight or else enough shut up the comet's going to split in two and strike the town over five hundred will die how dare you stand there and spout such nonsense if you're serious you must be sick i guess recklessness is a miyamizu trait i'll have a car take you to the city hospital for an examination we will continue this discussion after you've seen a doctor you you son of a  mitsuha' mitsuha no wait a minute who are you i'll see you guys at the

you're doing sorry mitsuha this is the end oh my god it's actually splittin' apart look at that the comet has split into two large parts and meteors are now falling to earth uh i don't believe anyone could have predicted this either way we have quite the mystical view here so what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us the comet's not within the roche limit so the nucleus itself must've had a structural weakness for this to happen comet shoemaker levy nine broke apart and collided with jupiter in nineteen ninety four there were at least twenty one fragments i'm going outside to take a look the fragments will likely burn up well before reaching the ground does it pose a danger probability of a meteor actually landing on a populated area is quite small never foresaw this development to predict the trajectory as we stand here witnessing this spectacle unassisted and with our bare eyes it strikes me that living in such an age has never felt more fortunate than now hey who are you who who who is he someone precious someone i shouldn't forget someone i didn't want to who who who are you what's your name oh no ah argh ungh so that we don't forget things when we wake up let's write down our names writing this doesn't help i won't know your name dad mitsuha there you are don't tell me you're back ah it was almost like seeing something out of a dream nothing more or less than a breathtaking view words like tomorrow or future or fate no matter how far they extend their hands we breathe we dream we raise our love in a timeless land that is far out of reach even the second hour hands of the clock they look at us sideways as they tick and tock how i hope to have forever to spend this life no all future lives right here in this world with you huh why am i here what am i doing u uh the doors are closing please be careful i'm always searching for something this feeling has consumed me for some time the reason i applied for this position  the landscapes people live in  to build a city's landscape  even tokyo it might vanish too one day and so i wanna make landscapes that how should i put this that can continue to warm peoples' hearts that bad how many does that make it i' doesn't sound too promising who asked you that suit could be the problem it looks just like yours well i have two offers i have eight myself is what i'm searching for someone or somewhere or am i just searching for the right job i don't even really know oh you're job hunting huh i haven't had much luck though hey maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances uh does it really look that bad on me so why the sudden call today i was in the area for work and i figured it had been a while since i saw your face remember that one time when we went all the way to itomori you were still in high school back then so it was heh five years ago that long it seems like i've forgotten a lot i don't remember all that much either about back then maybe we argued she and tsukasa went back to tokyo without me i spent the night alone on some mountain that's about all i remember but at one point in time i found myself strangely drawn to the incident involving that comet a fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster but miraculously most of the people living in the town were unhurt the town happened to be holding an emergency drill that day and most of its residents were outside the impact zone the sheer luck and coincidence of it all sparked various conspiracy theories i read a lot articles about it back then i was kind of obsessed but whatever the reason i had for my interest is a mystery to me now i didn't even know anybody in that town thanks for today this is far enough i do hope that at some point you'll find happiness too i feel like i'm always searching for something someone i feel like i do wanna go to one more bridal fair they're all the same a shinto weddin' sure sounds nice too you said you wanted to be married in a chapel oh that reminds me teshi uh would ya please shave before the ceremony i'm goin' on a diet for it you know she says as she's eatin' a cake i'll get serious tomorrow uh the landscape of a town that's no longer there why does looking at it make my chest feel so tight now just a little more only just a little more let's stay here a little longer now just a little more only just a little more let's stick together just a little bit longer just a little more only just a little more let's stay here a little longer now now just a little more only just a little more let's stick together just a little bit longer searching for someone oh yes we are time fliers scaling the walls of time climber tired of playing hide and seek with time and always comin' dead short i'll never let you go now promise i will never let you go now 'cause my hand finally has reached yours why should i have to oh you're sure quite a showy crier wanna stop your tears see your eyes drier but when i went to wipe your tears dry you refused but i saw them pouring down your face i knew why crying even when you're happy smiling even when you're feeling lonely it's because a part of you has made it here before the rest has excuse me haven't we have i met you somewhere i thought so too can i ask you can i ask you your name your name the sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me where did it find the loneliness it carried on the breeze looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears i could see for miles of blue it's never been so clear speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair somehow i feel a warmth and comfort today your ever kind heart the way you smile and even how you find your dreams i knew nothing so honestly i've always copied you now just a little more only just a little more let's stay here a little longer now now just a little more only just a little more let's stick together just a little bit longer oh yes we are time fliers scaling the walls of time climber tired of playing hide and seek with time and always comin' dead short crying even when you're happy smiling even when you're feeling lonely it's because a part of you has made it here before the rest has i used to wish upon the stars the toys that i once adored forgotten now are rollin' 'round the corners of the floor finally my dream has counted up to a hundred today someday i'll trade them all for just the very one girl that i have seen in school that never have told hello after class today i waved and said see you tomorrow it's not really that bad trying something new every once in a while especially if i can do it with you by my side now just a little more only just a little more let's stay here a little longer now just a little more only just a little more let's stick together just a little bit longer oh yes we are time fliers so and i i knew who you were way before way before i even knew my own name there's no clue but i'm sure i swear even if you're not around in this wide world of course it surely would have some kind of meaning but if when you're not around in this crazy world would be like the month of august without summer break and if you're not around in this great world would be like santa claus without any glee if you're not around in this wide world oh yes we are time fliers scaling the walls of time climber tired of playing hide and seek with time and always comin' dead short no never mind that no never mind what i said now 'cause i'm on my way to you oh we are time fliers dashing up the steps of time now no more playing hide and seek with you and time and always comin' dead short you're quite a showy crier wanna stop your tears see your eyes drier but when i went to wipe your tears dry you refused but i saw them pouring down your face i knew why crying even when i'm happy smiling even when i'm feeling lonely it's because the heart of mine has made it here before my body

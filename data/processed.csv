465;2087710;2093270;"a skill from the god they represent the flow of time itself."

667;3240770;3242800;"it was cute."
668;3242800;3247480;"although i do think what he's been telling us is definitely strange sounding."
669;3249250;3255440;"but in the end the fact remains that taki's met someone and that someone is the reason he changed."
670;3255840;3259700;"that much is for sure."
672;3273220;3275720;"it was all just a dream."
673;3276590;3278590;"i recognized the landscape"

836;4046020;4050370;"yeah we have water gel explosives we use for construction at our storage site."
837;4050370;4053010;"and the warning system"
838;4053360;4057150;"our startup frequency can hijack the town's warning system pretty easily"
839;4057150;4061340;"so we can broadcast an evacuation warning for the whole town right from school"
840;4061380;4063690;"look we're outside the disaster area here"
841;4063690;4066460;"so we'll just make an announcement to evacuate to the school."
842;4066460;4067770;"it's "
843;4067770;4070970;"it's totally a crime you'll be in charge of the broadcast saya."
844;4070970;4073460;"why me you're in the broadcast club."

846;4077250;4082140;"why 'cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from town hall then nobody's gonna go anyway."
847;4082140;4085470;"but if i talk to the mayor as his daughter i can convince him."
848;4085470;4088120;"it's the perfect plan"
849;4088700;4091300;"fine i don't really care one way or the other."
850;4091300;4094190;"this is just a theory of yours right"
851;4094800;4095810;"well"
852;4095810;4101590;"theories can be based on reality. like do you know the story of how itomori lake was formed it's a crater"
854;4101590;4108090;"that means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago right. that's why "

864;4145110;4148030;"if you're serious you must be sick"
865;4148030;4152000;"i guess recklessness is a miyamizu trait."
866;4152820;4156450;"i'll have a car take you to the city hospital for an examination."
867;4156450;4160380;"we will continue this discussion after you've seen a doctor."

1120;5247270;5250780;"this is itomori town hall."
1121;5250780;5255310;"we are currently confirming the reports of the accident."
1122;5255490;5262180;"we instruct all residents to remain calm and stay where they are until further notice. i guess we have to stay put"
1123;5262430;5264700;"what is goin' on so stay on standby."
1124;5265500;5270360;"come on they said everyone should evacuate the high school's the evacuation center"
1125;5270360;5272500;"katsuhiko"

1127;5275740;5278510;"what do you think you're doing"
1128;5280700;5282490;"sorry mitsuha."
1129;5283480;5285440;"this is the end."
1130;5287020;5288520;"oh my god"
1131;5288520;5291330;"it's actually splittin' apart"
1132;5297710;5303890;"look at that the comet has split into two large parts and meteors are now falling to earth"
1133;5304140;5308380;"uh i don't believe anyone could have predicted this. either way we have quite the mystical view here."
1134;5308380;5311870;"so what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us"
1135;5311870;5317690;"the comet's not within the roche limit so the nucleus itself must've had a structural weakness for this to happen."
1136;5317690;5322520;"comet shoemaker levy nine broke apart and collided with jupiter in nineteen ninety four."
1137;5323060;5325220;"there were at least twenty one fragments i'm going outside to take a look."
1138;5325220;5328650;"the fragments will likely burn up well before reaching the ground. does it pose a danger"
1139;5328650;5333020;"probability of a meteor actually landing on a populated area is quite small."
1140;5333020;5334650;"never foresaw this development."
1141;5334650;5338770;"to predict the trajectory as we stand here witnessing this spectacle"
1142;5338770;5340270;"unassisted"
1143;5340270;5341590;"and with our bare eyes"
1144;5341590;5346970;"it strikes me that living in such an age has never felt more fortunate than now."
1145;5349580;5350700;"hey"
1146;5351210;5352310;"who"
1147;5352310;5354000;"are you"

1151;5362260;5364030;"someone precious."
1152;5364030;5366020;"someone i shouldn't forget"
1153;5366020;5368740;"someone i didn't want to"
1154;5368740;5370430;"who"

1156;5371510;5373410;"who are you"
1157;5373410;5376150;"what's your name"
1158;5381010;5382460;"oh no"
1159;5382520;5383880;"ah argh"
1160;5387660;5388780;"ungh"
1161;5401840;5404410;"so that we don't forget things when we wake up"
1162;5404410;5406990;"let's write down our names."
1164;5433580;5435160;"writing this"
1165;5435160;5436790;"doesn't help"
1166;5436790;5439090;"i won't know your name"
1167;5452080;5454280;"dad"
1168;5454830;5456900;"mitsuha. there you are"
1169;5456900;5459110;"don't tell me you're back"
1170;5459110;5461000;"ah"
1171;5463000;5466090;"it was almost like seeing something out of a dream."
1172;5466510;5468340;"nothing more or less"
1173;5468340;5470700;"than a breathtaking view."
1174;5470700;5475110;"words like tomorrow or future or fate"
1175;5475110;5478910;"no matter how far they extend their hands"
1176;5478910;5482720;"we breathe we dream we raise our love"
1177;5482720;5486860;"in a timeless land that is far out of reach."
1178;5486860;5490530;"even the second hour hands of the clock."
1179;5490530;5494550;"they look at us sideways as they tick and tock."
1180;5494550;5499410;"how i hope to have forever to spend this life"
1181;5499410;5501830;"no all future lives"
1182;5501830;5509630;"right here in this world with you"
1183;5562390;5563850;"huh"
1184;5564310;5565880;"why am i here"
1185;5567170;5569980;"what am i doing"
1186;5588570;5589680;"u uh"
1187;5594310;5598010;"the doors are closing. please be careful."
1188;5600600;5603400;"i'm always searching for something."
1189;5603400;5607030;"this feeling has consumed me"
1190;5607030;5608990;"for some time."
1191;5610290;5612350;"the reason i applied for this position "
1192;5612350;5613890;"the landscapes people live in "
1193;5613890;5615840;"to build a city's landscape "
1194;5615840;5618800;"even tokyo. it might vanish too one day."
1195;5618800;5623210;"and so i wanna make landscapes that how should i put this"
1196;5623210;5626700;"that can continue to warm peoples' hearts."
1197;5628340;5630650;"that bad how many does that make it"
1198;5630650;5633400;"i've stopped counting. doesn't sound too promising."
1199;5633400;5635990;"who asked you that suit could be the problem."
1200;5635990;5637760;"it looks just like yours"
1201;5637760;5641170;"well i have two offers. i have eight myself."
1203;5646290;5648380;"is what i'm searching for"
1204;5648380;5649880;"someone"
1205;5649880;5651370;"or somewhere"
1206;5652110;5655390;"or am i just searching for the right job"
1207;5655390;5657320;"i don't even really know."
1208;5658030;5659220;"oh"
1209;5659220;5663100;"you're job hunting huh i haven't had much luck though."
1210;5663100;5667950;"hey maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances. uh does it really look that bad on me"
1211;5672250;5674850;"so why the sudden call today"
1212;5674850;5680010;"i was in the area for work and i figured it had been a while since i saw your face."
1214;5682130;5686070;"remember that one time when we went all the way to itomori"
1215;5686070;5689350;"you were still in high school back then so it was"
1216;5689350;5692580;"heh. five years ago. that long"
1217;5693160;5694530;"it seems like"
1218;5694530;5697130;"i've forgotten a lot."
1219;5697410;5699950;"i don't remember all that much either."
1220;5699950;5701700;"about back then."
1221;5702090;5704200;"maybe we argued."
1222;5704200;5707460;"she and tsukasa went back to tokyo without me."
1223;5707980;5711010;"i spent the night alone on some mountain."
1224;5711670;5713980;"that's about all i remember."
1225;5716340;5723330;"but at one point in time i found myself strangely drawn to the incident involving that comet."
1226;5725500;5729000;"a fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster"
1228;5729460;5731000;"but miraculously"
1229;5731000;5734210;"most of the people living in the town were unhurt."
1230;5734670;5738010;"the town happened to be holding an emergency drill that day"
1233;5738020;5741380;"and most of its residents were outside the impact zone."
1236;5742610;5747600;"the sheer luck and coincidence of it all sparked various conspiracy theories."
1238;5748360;5751130;"i read a lot articles about it back then."
1240;5751130;5752990;"i was kind of obsessed."
1241;5753640;5759000;"but whatever the reason i had for my interest is a mystery to me now."
1242;5760350;5763000;"i didn't even know anybody in that town."
1243;5766370;5769100;"thanks for today. this is far enough."
1244;5770240;5772080;"i do hope"
1245;5772080;5773980;"that at some point"
1246;5773980;5776980;"you'll find happiness too."
1247;5779760;5782690;"i feel like i'm always searching."
1248;5782690;5784430;"for something."
1249;5784430;5786020;"someone."
1251;5797090;5800240;"i feel like i do wanna go to one more bridal fair."
1252;5800240;5801640;"they're all the same"
1253;5801640;5806620;"a shinto weddin' sure sounds nice too you said you wanted to be married in a chapel"
1254;5806620;5808710;"oh that reminds me teshi uh"
1255;5808690;5813380;"would ya please shave before the ceremony i'm goin' on a diet for it you know."

1257;5815500;5818710;"i'll get serious tomorrow. uh"
1263;5876440;5879650;"the landscape of a town that's no longer there."
1264;5879650;5883940;"why does looking at it make my chest feel so tight"
1265;5920490;5923020;"now just a little more"
1266;5923020;5926200;"only just a little more."

1293;6005900;6008530;"smiling even when you're feeling lonely."
1294;6008530;6010490;"it's because a part of you"
1295;6010490;6013410;"has made it here before the rest has."
1296;6027090;6028730;"excuse me"

1305;6062920;6068680;"looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears"
1306;6068680;6074290;"i could see for miles of blue it's never been so clear."
1307;6085630;6091430;"speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair."

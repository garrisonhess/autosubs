00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,090
Some mornings, I wake up crying
without knowing why.

3
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,440
That's when everything happens
now and again.

4
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,540
Whatever that dream was I had,
I can never remember it.

5
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,550
- But...
- But...

6
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,190
the only thing that
does last when I wake up

7
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,190
is a sense of loss,

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,190
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

9
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm always searching for something

10
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
or someone.

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,090
Mitsuha: I've been consumed by this feeling...

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,090
ever since that day.

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,910
Taki: The day... a star fell.

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,460
It was almost like...

15
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,450
-like seeing something out of a dream.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,450
Nothing more or less...

17
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,400
- than a breathtaking view.
- than a breathtaking view.

18
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,430
Ah, if only our voices speak at night

19
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,100
could ever reach the very
edge of this world

20
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,610
and of time

21
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,790
instead of fading into air and dust.

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,840
Then what will the words, could it ever be

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,540
farthest words from "probably"?

24
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's make a promise that will never fade.

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,830
Let's say it together on
the count of three, oh.

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,960
Ah, I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard,

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,730
but lately I've lost sight of
the truth in those words.

28
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,980
I can't even remember when
I gave up believing.

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,550
What could have been the reason?

30
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,870
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,410
in the place rainbow born and dies.

32
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,350
And where the end of this life lies,

33
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,020
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for.

34
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,990
One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored, unprecedented.

35
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,720
We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time.

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,380
The five dimensions keeps on teasing me,

37
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,440
but I will keep on looking at you, dear.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,770
Let's make a sign for when we
say "nice to meet you" again.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm on my way to you,

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,610
chasing after your name.

41
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,140
Taki...

42
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,890
Taki.

43
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,900
Taki!

44
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,270
Don't you remember?

45
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,330
My name is...

46
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,020
Mitsuha!

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,010
Sis, what are you... doing?

48
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,390
Whoa, they're so realistic-feeling...

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,110
"Sis"?

50
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,220
Me?

51
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,880
Are you still asleep?

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,010
Breakfast time, hurry up!

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,050
Huh?

54
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,420
Wha-?

55
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,260
WHAAAT?!

56
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,490
Do you wanna have any of
last night's fish, grandma?

57
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,190
You can eat it.

58
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,210
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'!

59
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,330
Lazy butt, you're so slow!

60
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,540
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

61
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,490
Oh, that's a lot...

62
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,850
-Oh, well.

63
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,060
- You're back to normal today.
- Huh?

64
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,750
- You were so crazy yesterday.
- What do you mean, "crazy"?

65
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,380
-Attention, citizens of Itomori.

66
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,650
Good morning!

67
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,400
This is an official announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

68
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,330
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

69
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,390
The election will be held
on the 20th of next month.

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,240
The election committee would
like to remind everyone tha-

71
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,320
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
A comet that comes only
once every 1,200 years

73
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,770
will finally be headed our way in a month.

74
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,120
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for
several days once it approaches the Earth...

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,270
Just make up with him already, okay?

76
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,360
- That's an adult matter.
- According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're preparing for the celestial show of the millennium.

77
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,070
"Position of Comet Tiamat"

78
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,070
"Closest on October 4th"

79
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,120
- We're leaving!
- We're leaving!

80
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,550
Yotsuha: I can't wait 'til the festival!
It's gonna be so much fun!

81
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,570
Study hard, sis!

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,860
Ah!

83
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,420
Mitsuha!

84
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,370
Good mornin', Saya! Mornin', Teshi!

85
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,040
- Mornin'!
- Come on, would you get off already?

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,160
- What for, meanie?
- 'Cause you're heavy.

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,360
- Hey, that's rude!
- Y'know, I gotta say. You two make a great couple.

88
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,050
- No, we don't!
- No, we don't!

89
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,930
Oh, I see you actually
bothered to do your hair today.

90
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,780
-Wait, what?
-Oh, yeah. What happened?
Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?

91
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,200
- Exorcise?
- Somethin' totally possessed your body!

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,190
Would you just give it a rest
with all this occult nonsense?

93
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,660
- Mitsuha's gotta be feelin'
stressed enough as it is, right?
- What are you guys talking about?

94
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Are you feelin' okay?

95
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,710
And above all, restoring the town's fiscal health
so we can continue our revitalization project.

96
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,610
It's only when all these things are achieved
that we can create a safe and secure community.

97
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,900
- As the incumbent, my administration...
- Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,270
I hear he's been dullin' out the pork.
Just between us.

99
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,450
- Hey, Miyamizu.
- Mornin'.

100
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,650
Looks like the mayor and the
contractor's kid are pretty cozy, too.

101
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,790
-To improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

102
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,540
- Mitsuha!
- [Gasp]

103
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,140
Stand up straight when you're walking!

104
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,510
Oh, he's tough on his family.

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,970
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

106
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,420
- Awkward.
- Sucks to be her.

107
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,140
Mitsuha!

108
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,480
In front of everyone.

109
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,180
"Who are you?"

110
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,110
"Tasokare" [Twilight]

111
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,010
"Two light." That's the
origin of the word twilight.

112
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,770
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

113
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,220
It's dusk, a time when
it's neither day nor night.

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,690
When the border between worlds blur,

115
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,670
and one might encounter
something not human.

116
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,350
Another older term for it is dusk light.

117
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,510
Some people also call it "golden hour".

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,210
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

119
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,370
-What about "magic hour"?
It's something my grandma says.

120
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,140
-Well, golden hour and magic
hour are technically the same,

121
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,860
but it's a term that
mostly photographers use.

122
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,220
"Who are you?"

123
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,780
- Well, she does take a lot of pictures.
- [CLASS Laughing]

124
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,980
-Okay, next...

125
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,330
- Miyamizu!
- Uh, yes?

126
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, I can see that you
remember your own name today.

127
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
[Laughing]

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,660
Sayaka: You... don't remember?
Mitsuha: Uh-uh...

129
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,980
Plus, you had the worst case of bedhead,
and you didn't have your ribbon on, either!

131
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,540
What?! No way!

132
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,190
Yeah, it was like you
had amnesia or somethin'.

133
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,840
Now that you mention it, I do feel like
I've been havin' weird dreams lately.

134
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,860
Like a dream about someone else's life?

135
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,120
It's all so fuzzy.

136
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,660
Wait a sec, I've got it...

137
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,420
It's memories from a previous life,

138
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,250
or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

139
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,570
Keep your full mouth shut!

140
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,390
Wait a minute! Teshi, don't tell me you
were the one who wrote in my noteboo... k.

141
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
Forget it.

142
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,500
But you really were actin' just a
little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

143
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,730
You been feelin' okay?

144
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,450
That's what's weird. I feel fine.

145
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,600
Maybe it's from stress. You know, you've
got that ritual comin' up soon, don'tcha?

146
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Ugh, don't remind me!

147
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,380
I can't stand this place anymore!
It's too small and town-ey.

148
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,870
I wanna graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

149
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,130
-Can't say I blame you. There really
is nothin' at all in this town.

150
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,660
-There's only one train that stops here every two
hours -and all the stores close at nine o' clock.

151
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,770
No bookstores, no dentists,

152
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,940
"Mother's" "Cat's Eye Pub"

153
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,140
but two cocktail lounges
for whatever reason.

154
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,620
- No jobs in town.
- No one date-able.

155
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,230
Even the days are too short.

156
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,470
You know what?!

157
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,150
- No, what?
- No, what?

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,500
Forget that stuff.
Why don't we go to a café?

159
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,960
- A café?
- Really?

160
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,260
- Where?!
- Where?!

161
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,800
Hello, kids!

162
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
- Hi, there!
- Evenin', ma'am!

163
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,740
- How is this a café?
- Like this town's got a café.

164
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,680
Mitsuha just went straight home.

165
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,480
- Things have gotta be really
rough for her right now.
- She's on center stage and all.

166
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Yeah...

167
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,440
- Hey, Teshi...
- Hm?

168
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,900
What are you gonna do after
you graduate high school?

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,880
Where'd that come from?
You talkin' about the future?

170
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,370
Mh-hm.

171
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,950
I dunno. I think I'll probably just end up
livin' in this town, y'know. Same as ever.

172
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,940
I wanna do what you're doin'.

173
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,850
It's still too soon for you to
try, Yotsuha.

174
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,380
Listen to the thread's voice.

175
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,880
When you twine it round and round like this, feelings
will start flowing between you and the thread.

176
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,950
- It's not like threads talk...
- She's telling you to focus.

177
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,570
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

178
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,620
Listen. Somethin' happened
two hundred years ago...

179
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,040
Here she goes.

180
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,170
The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki
caught on fire and this whole area burned down.

181
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,650
The shrine and old
documents were destroyed.

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,070
- This is known as...
- Mayugoro's Great Fire.

183
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,600
They named the fire after him?!
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

184
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,150
The meaning behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

185
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,740
Only the surface was left.

186
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,040
But even if those words are
gone, those words shouldn't fade.

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,530
That's the Miyamizu shrine's duty.
Our important task.

188
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,830
Ugh...

189
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,660
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine!

190
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,360
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?!

191
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,010
Oh, he's hopeless!

192
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,540
-Have another, mister foreman.

193
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,390
- I'll be counting on your
help again for this election.
- Leave it to me.

194
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,320
You'll get the votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts, guaranteed.

195
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,960
- How's the datin' scene?
- It ain't easy, that's for sure.

196
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,520
- Smells like corruption in there.
- What are you talkin' about?

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,280
- We're gonna need two
or three more bottles.
- Yes, dear.

198
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,310
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help
out at the site this weekend.

199
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,520
- We'll be usin' explosives,
so you better study up.
- Grngh.

200
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,580
What was that?!

201
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Got it!

202
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,930
Guess we both can't stand things here.

203
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,180
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

204
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,900
They're lookers, alright.
Just like their mother.

205
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,520
- Heya!
- Hey.

206
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,700
World's oldest kind of sake,

207
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,660
but chewin' on rice, spittin' it out, and then
lettin' it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

208
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Kuchikamizake.

209
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,720
Do the gods really appreciate that.
The way it's ma-

210
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,910
Yeah, of course they do!

211
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,010
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

212
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:04,030
-Ugh! I'd never do that!
-And in front of everybody!
Embarrassing, right?

213
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,870
You should try to cheer up, sis.

214
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,010
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw that?

215
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,940
It must be nice for you
not being a teenager.

216
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, I know! You should just sell
Kuchikamizake and move to Tokyo!

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,860
I bet you could sell it with all sorts of
stuff like photos and making-of videos.

218
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh, and then you can call it "Shrine
Maiden's Sake"! You'll make buttloads!

219
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,890
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

220
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,280
I can't! There are liquor laws!

221
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,470
That's what you have a problem with?

222
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,320
I hate this town! I hate this life, too!

223
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,690
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

224
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,770
Yotsuha: What a jackass.

225
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,820
Ow...

226
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,480
Where...?

227
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,260
Huh?

228
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,840
Hmm?

229
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,020
Something's... there...

230
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,040
Aaaah!

231
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
Eh!

232
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,840
Taki's Father: Taki, you up?

233
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,780
It was your turn to cook breakfast,
wasn't it? Did you sleep in?

234
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,690
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,040
Ugh, I'm heading out.

236
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,110
- Finish the miso.
- Uh, okay...

237
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,640
Make sure you go to school,
even if you're late. Seeya.

238
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,550
H-have a nice day.

239
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,860
What a strange dream...

240
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,300
[Gasp]

241
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,390
"From Tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

242
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,080
Huh? It's from "Tsukasa"?

243
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,990
Who's that? Hrm.

244
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,160
Uhhh...

245
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,660
I gotta go pee.

246
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,430
Way too real...

247
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
"Shinjuku Station"

248
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm in Tokyo!

249
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,690
"Jingu High School"

250
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,840
- Where did you get this?
- Daikanyama.

251
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Guess who's opening at our next gig?

252
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,180
- W-wait wait, we have a gig?
- Hey, let's skip club stuff
today and catch a movie.

253
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,850
Uh...

254
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,710
Taaaki!

255
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,660
Can't believe you got in at noon.
Come on, let's grab lunch!

256
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,250
You ignored my text, too!

257
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,380
- Mr. Tsukasa.
- "Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

258
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,870
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

259
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,030
Wait a second. How'd you wind up
getting lost on the way to school?

260
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,110
Uh...

261
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,900
-Well, a girl-
-A girl?

262
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,870
A gal-

263
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,600
- Hm?
- Hm?

264
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,500
I mean...

265
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,390
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

266
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,400
A guy...

267
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,120
- [Nod]
- [Nod]

268
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,830
Y'know, guys just wanna have fun. Every day's a
festival when you're living in Tokyo... as a guy.

269
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,160
Hey, you... sound funny.

270
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,260
-And where's your lunch?

271
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,950
- Seriously?
- What is up with you?

272
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,370
- We could share somethin'.
- Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

273
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,310
-Yes! Hahahaha!

274
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,730
Ah...

275
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,410
Thank you!

276
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,190
- Wanna hit the café later?
- Oh, that one? Sure.

277
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,000
-You in, Taki?

278
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,080
-What? What?! WHAT?!

279
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,360
A café?!

280
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,580
- They've got nice timberwork in here.
- Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

281
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,720
Taki, all set?

282
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,630
Uh...[Gasp]

283
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,860
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

284
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,900
-Uh... maybe a decade ago.

285
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,850
-Hmmm...

286
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

287
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,880
Dreams are great!

288
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Huh?

289
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,970
Wha? Oh no! I think that I'm late for work.

290
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,260
- You got a shift today?
- Guess you better get goin'.

291
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,460
Right.

292
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,710
Sorry, but uh...

293
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,470
Where exactly do I work?

294
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,910
- Wha?
- Wha?

295
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,430
- Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!
- Table twelve! Taki!

296
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,490
Got it!

297
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,020
Here you go.

298
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,250
So, the zucchini and tomato
salad with a side of...

299
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
- We didn't order that!
- Wha?

300
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,320
- Taki! I told you that
we are out of truffles!
- Taki, you gotta talk louder!

301
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,500
Taki!

302
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,940
When is this nightmare gonna be over?!

303
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,500
Diner: Waiter.

304
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,080
- Hey, you.
- Uh, yes?

305
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,420
See this? Does it look right?
A toothpick's in it.

306
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,420
What would have happened if we ate it?

307
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,370
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

308
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,790
-Do something.
-Uh... it's just that...

309
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,770
Well, I don't even think
we have toothpicks at this-

310
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,820
What?!

311
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,450
Excuse me. Is everything alright over here?

312
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,760
- Well, like I was trying to tell the guy...
- I'll take care of this.

313
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,420
What's wrong with you today?

314
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,690
We truly apologize.
Your meal is on the house tonight.

315
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,840
Why, thank you.

316
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,490
You weren't hurt, were you?

317
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,710
- Uh... Oku... dera?
- That's "Miss" to you.

318
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,740
-Miss Okudera. About before-
-We just had some bad luck is all.

319
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,260
-No, I- I-
-Those guys were definitely scamming us.

320
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,330
I handled it according to the
manual, but still...

321
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,570
Uh-Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

322
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,000
- Are you alright?
- Did something happen?

323
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Looks like someone cut it.

324
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,910
That guy...

325
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,910
- Do you remember what he looked like?
- No...

326
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,750
- Come with me.
- Hey, Taki.

327
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,730
Okay, take off your skirt.

328
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,590
What?!

329
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,360
N- wh- I'll... I'll look the other way!

330
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,850
Hold on, this won't take long.

331
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,520
All done! Ta-da!

332
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,510
You're really good, Taki!
It's way cuter now!

333
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,620
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

334
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,000
To be honest, well...
I was worried about you.

335
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You aren't that strong,
but you're quick to pick a fight.

336
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
I like you better today.

337
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,720
You've got a feminine side.
Who woulda guessed?

338
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
"JR Yamanote Line: 7 min."

339
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,220
I gotta say,
this dream sure does seem real.

340
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,080
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

341
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,990
So organized.

342
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,490
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

343
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,670
One of her.

344
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,830
Unrequited love?

345
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,540
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

346
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,380
"Who are you?"

347
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,790
"Mitsuha"

348
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,380
What is this?

349
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,380
"Mitsuha"

350
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,810
Wha?!

351
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,300
What?!

352
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,750
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

353
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,200
What is going on?!

354
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,140
So, café today?

355
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,530
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

356
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,700
Ha, do you remember where to go?

357
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,680
Huh?...Ah!

358
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,740
Wait a second. Was that you, Tsukasa? Are you
the one that's been messing with my phone?

359
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,370
Uh... Never mind.

360
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,120
Later.

361
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
Well, he's back to normal.

362
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,440
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

363
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,420
Uhhhhh....

364
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,160
Uh... what's up?

365
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,480
Don't play dumb.
What about bro code, huh?!

366
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah, you walked home
with her yesterday, right?

367
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,630
Uh, what are you talking about?
Me and Ms. Okudera?

368
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,310
- So what did you guys do?!
- So what did you guys do?!
- So what did you guys do?!

369
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,630
Uh, well... I don't remember, actually.

370
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,610
Quit messin' around and tell us!

371
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,540
Okudera, reporting for duty!

372
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,400
-Don't slack off today, you guys.
We're gonna have a good day today.
-Yeah...

373
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,780
Aren't we, Taki?

374
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,900
Hmmm?

375
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,400
"Mitsuha? Who are you?? What are you??"

376
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,900
Yotsuha: I see you're not touching
your boobies today.

377
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,980
Breakfast time! Hurry up!

378
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,050
MY BOOBS?!

379
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,640
Mornin'!

380
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,220
I feel like everyone's
starin' at me for some reason.

381
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,680
- Well you did kinda make a scene yesterday.
- Uh?!

382
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,150
"Still-life drawing"

383
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,320
-Did you see all the election posters?

384
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,490
-Doesn't matter who wins, nothin'll
change, 'cept for who gets the kickback.

385
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,010
-Shhh! Somebody's daddy's dependent on it.

386
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,080
-They're talking about me, right?

387
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,460
Uh... [Nod]

388
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,740
Wait, Mitsuha?!

389
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,020
I... I...

390
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,220
I did what?!

391
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,220
Mitsuha?

392
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,520
"What is this life?"

393
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,730
Could this... could this mean-

394
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,030
-No, no, no, no! Could this mean...
that we're really-

395
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,400
That we're...
in our dreams, that guy and I-

396
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,430
That we're...
in our dreams, that girl and I-

397
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,040
"Life in Tokyo"

398
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,040
"What is this life?"

399
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,540
- We're switching places?!
- We're switching places?!

400
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,140
At last, hello, you've opened your eyes,

401
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,690
but why won't you even look me in the eyes,
what's wrong with you?

402
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,250
You angrily tell me that I'm late.

403
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,990
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace!

404
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,740
Mitsuha: I'm slowly beginning to
realize what's going on.

405
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,200
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

406
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,490
Taki: Two or three times a week, I'll suddenly and randomly
switch with Mitsuha, who's somewhere out in the boonies.

407
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,540
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

408
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,990
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"

409
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,390
Mitsuha: Any memories I have of the switch
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

410
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,450
Taki: But there's no doubt that
we're switching places.

411
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,150
The reactions of everyone
around us prove it.

412
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,620
And that's why...

413
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,730
Mitsuha: That's why we decided to lay out some ground
rules so we could protect each other's way of life.

414
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,040
"Strictly forbidden!"

415
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,130
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

416
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,530
Things to watch out for during the switches,
and a list of stuff we should never do.

417
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,470
"Don't waste money!
No dialect! Don't be late!"

418
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,160
Taki: We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places...

419
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,560
Mitsuha: So that we can work together to get
through this... weird thing that's happening.

420
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,570
-And yet...

421
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,030
-And yet...

422
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,520
- I cannot believe this guy!
- I cannot believe this girl!

423
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,100
Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,

424
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
been looking everywhere for you.

425
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,590
I followed the sound of
your innocent laughter,

426
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,690
and it guided me in the right way.

427
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,210
Even if every piece of you disappeared

428
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,450
and if it scattered everywhere...

429
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,110
Mitsuha: Guys will stare. Watch the skirt!

430
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,810
These are basics for a girl!

431
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,950
"Careful with skirts!"

432
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,410
Taki: Stop wasting my money on sweets!
Mitsuha: It's goin' in your body.
Plus, I also worked for that money.

433
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,300
"Braided Cords..."

434
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,070
Taki: Braiding cords is impossible!

435
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,660
Mitsuha: You work way too many shifts!
Taki: 'Cause you keep wasting money!

436
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,210
I wonder if we can push our way through

437
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,910
the countless barrier that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view.

438
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,420
Side-by-side, no way we can lose.

439
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,520
We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules.

440
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,700
Mitsuha: Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the
way home. You two have a good thing going!

441
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,210
Taki: Quit messing with my
relationships, Mitsuha!

442
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,850
-Hey, Taki... why is a girl
confessing her love to me?

443
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,350
-Maybe you're just more
popular when I'm you.

444
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,490
-You're so full of yourself!
Like you have a girlfriend!

445
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,360
"Don't be so full of yourself!!"

446
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,970
-It's not like you have anyone, either!

447
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,720
- I don't...
- I don't...

448
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,530
"Dummy"

449
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,530
"Idiot"

450
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,870
- Because I don't want a relationship!
- Because I don't want a relationship!

451
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,210
I shouldn't for her sake.

452
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,710
Yotsuha: You sure do like your own boobies.

453
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,960
Time to go! Get ready!

454
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,810
Over the course of the last few days, the Tiamat comet
has been visible, but when and where can people see it?

455
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,250
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

456
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:26,980
The Tiamat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does: from East to West from our point of view.

457
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,310
Why are you wearin' your uniform?

458
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,370
Yotsuha: Grandma, why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

459
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,830
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

460
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,420
- Who's Mayugoro?
- What? He's famous!

461
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,340
Hop on, grandma.

462
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,780
- Oh!
- Watch out! Careful!

463
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,070
Mitsuha. Yotsuha. Do you know about Musubi?

464
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,200
Mu... subi?

465
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,060
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago, and it means "union".

466
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,300
This word has profound meaning.

467
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Tying strings together is a union, connecting to
people is a union, and the flow of time is a union.

468
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:47,710
These are all part of the god's power. The
braided cords that we make are tied to that.

469
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,270
A skill from the god,
they represent the flow of time itself.

470
00:34:53,970 --> 00:35:01,940
They assemble and take shape. They twist,
tangle, unravel now and then, break...

471
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,050
and reconnect.

472
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,240
That's what a union is. What time is.

473
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,080
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

474
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,100
- I want some, too!
- That's also a union.

475
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:26,310
Whether it's water, rice or sake, when something
becomes a part of a person, it's a union.

476
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,960
It joins their soul, which is why the offering
we're making today is such an important custom.

477
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,350
It connects the god with people.

478
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,110
Hey, I can see it!

479
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,980
This is where it is.
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

480
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:10,490
What lies ahead is the hereafter.
It's the netherworld.

481
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,360
The netherworld!

482
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:23,170
In order to return to this world, you have to
leave behind what is most important to you.

483
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,380
Like the kuchikamizake.

484
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,230
Kuchikamizake?

485
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:37,160
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine
god's relic. After all, it is half of you.

486
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,670
Half... of Mitsuha.

487
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,010
Wow, it's already magic hour!

488
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,010
Magic hour?

489
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,730
- Oh, yeah! Maybe I can see the comet!
- Huh? The comet?

490
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,490
Oh, Mitsuha...

491
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,990
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

492
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,950
I'm crying? But why?

493
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,510
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

494
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,820
Ms. Okudera? She's almost where?

495
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh, Mitsuha. What did you do?

496
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,480
Date?!

497
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,300
Mitsuha: "Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Ms.
Okudera."

498
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,090
"Meet up at the station at 10:30!"

499
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,020
Well, that's what I had planned, but...

500
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,790
- Hi, Taki.
- Huh? Agh!

501
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,620
- Wait long?
- Yeah. Aah-no! Uh...

502
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,110
- I just got here.
- Thank goodness. Let's go!

503
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,090
Must be nice.
They've probably met up about now.

504
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,880
Huh?

505
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,740
Why am I...?

506
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,070
Why...?

507
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,700
"It was a date I wanted to go on, but if it so happens that
you end up goin', you better be grateful and enjoy it!"

508
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:27,780
This is nice! It's my first time here.
So, is this one of your usual go-to spots?

509
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,270
Mitsuha: "At any rate, I bet you've
never even been on a single date."

510
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,270
No way, it's too expensive!

511
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,230
I don't know what to say to her.

512
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,900
"That's why I've handpicked some links
below to help you out, ya wallflower!"

513
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,940
For real?

514
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,370
"You, too, can get a girlfriend!"

515
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,830
"Despite social anxiety, I got a girl!"
"The dos and don'ts of texting!"

516
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,370
She's making fun of me!

517
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,390
"Photo Exhibition: Nostalgia"

518
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,960
You know something, Taki?

519
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,230
Today, you're...
you're like a different person.

520
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:37,810
Ms. Okudera. You getting hungry?
We could get dinner.

521
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,630
- Uh... let's call it a day.
- U-uh... Alright.

522
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,470
- I could be wrong, and I'm sorry if I am...
- About?

523
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,410
But you used to have a
little crush on me, am I right?

524
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,070
But right now,
there's someone else you like, huh?

525
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,760
- N-n-no! U-uh-it's not that...
- Really?

526
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,190
- There's no one. It's not like that.
- Are you sure about that?

527
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,040
Well, thanks for today. See you at work!

528
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,750
Taki: By the time the date's over,

529
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,190
-you should be able to
see the comet in the sky.
-"...you should be able to
see the comet in the sky."

530
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,710
What does she mean? Weirdo.

531
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,130
-Oh.

532
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,820
Mitsuha: It's you, Teshi.

533
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,520
No. I just didn't feel like
goin', that's all. I'm fine.

534
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,610
What? The festival?

535
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,440
Ah...

536
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,250
Oh yeah, the comet.
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

537
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,490
Okay, got it. Seeya later!

538
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,600
You're just looking forward to seeing
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

539
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,340
I- I am not!

540
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

541
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,730
- Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.
- Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

542
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,120
It's not funny!

543
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,450
- Sorry to keep ya.
- Oh, she's here!
- You're late!

544
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,060
- [Gasp]
- [Gasp]

545
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,110
- Mitsuha, what happened to-?
- [Gasp]

546
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,070
-Your hair!

547
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,200
I guess... it's weird.

548
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,120
You think it's gotta do with some guy.
Like, he broke her heart?

549
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,480
Guys always just assume that
it has to do with a boy.

550
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,370
- She said she felt like cuttin' it.
- Ya sure about that? You really think she
felt like cuttin' off that much of it?

551
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,750
Hey guys, I can see it!

552
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,400
- Whoa, ho-ho!
- Whoa...
- Ah.

553
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,590
Huh?

554
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,780
Phone: "The number you are trying to reach is currently
outside the cellular network or has been turned off due-"

555
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,320
Taki: I'll just have to tell her how lousy
the date ended up the next time we switch.

556
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,630
That's what I thought.

557
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,430
But, for some reason,

558
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,630
the switches Mitsuha and I had
been going through until now...

559
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,400
they never happened again.

560
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,080
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

561
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,530
"Hida Mountains"

562
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,560
Wha-

563
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,940
What are-

564
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,530
What are you doing here?

565
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,580
Okudera: Tsukasa told me about it, so here I am.

566
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,900
I asked for two things: to cover my shift
and to back up my alibi if my dad asked.

567
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,980
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

568
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,400
Takagi: Gotch'a covered!

569
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,350
But you owe me dinner.

570
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,600
- So, you're all in on it...
- You've got everyone worried about you.

571
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,700
- Huh?
- We can't ignore this! What if somebody's
trying to pull one over on you?

572
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,850
Like catfish?

573
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,330
I mean, you met this person
online, didn't you?

574
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,800
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

575
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,860
- Could be from a dating site-
- She's NOT!

576
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,610
It's because you've been acting awfully
fishy lately, so we're keeping an eye on you.

577
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,320
I don't need a babysitter, okay!

578
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,980
Taki: The switches stopped, my calls never
connected, and texts never went through.

579
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,690
That's why I decided to
go see Mitsuha in person.

580
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,680
I wanted to see her, but...

581
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,730
-What? You don't know where she is exactly?
The town's landscape is your only clue?

582
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,740
Yeah.

583
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,410
And you can't contact her?
What's that about?

584
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,990
-Where are we?
You're a terrible tour guide-
-'Cause I'm not one!

585
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,570
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

586
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,230
- Aww, it's so cute! Look, Taki!
- Seriously, guys?

587
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,600
Okudera: It moved! Awww!

588
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,410
Taki: This is a lost cause.

589
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,530
- What?!
- What?!

590
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,500
After everything that
we've done for you today?!

591
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,650
You haven't done anything!

592
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,980
- One Takayama Ramen.
- One Takayama Ramen.

593
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,500
I guess I'll have the same.

594
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,840
Sure.

595
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,310
Waitress: Three orders of ramen.
Chef: Got it.

596
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,410
- Think we can make it
back to Tokyo tonight?
- Well, I think we'll be cuttin' it close.

597
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,540
Let me take a look.

598
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,180
- K, thanks.
- Wait, Taki. You sure about that?

599
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,030
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

600
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,190
Hey, that's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

601
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,690
It's drawn really well.

602
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,070
Come take a look at this, hon!

603
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,040
Yeah, that's Itomori. Takes me back.

604
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,630
My husband was born and raised
there, you know.

605
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,970
Itomori?

606
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,630
Yes, of course! That's the place!
It's nearby, right?

607
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,140
You don't...?

608
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,050
Itomori was...

609
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,990
Itomori...[Gasp]

610
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,640
- But that's where-!
- Wait! Isn't that the
area where that comet-?

611
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,840
Huh?

612
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,330
"Keep Out"

613
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,150
Hey...

614
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,280
Okudera: Is this place really where she's from?

615
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,190
Tsukasa: No way. Taki must have just
confused this with somewhere else.

616
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,300
Taki: No, I didn't.

617
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,420
This was the place.

618
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,730
The schoolyard, these mountains,

619
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,230
even this high school here!

620
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,790
I remember it all!

621
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,740
There's no way you could.

622
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,550
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

623
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,050
- Hundreds of people died.
- They died...

624
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,100
three years ago?

625
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,920
It can't be...

626
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,940
There's no way...

627
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,570
I mean...

628
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,250
I still have the memos she wrote.

629

They're fading.

630
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,610
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

three years ago in October.

would split at its perigee.

became a meteor and struck Japan.

It looks like that day was the
same date as the Autumn Festival.

641
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,490
The point of impact was here.

642
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,890
At 8:42 PM (20:42), it fell right around
where people were gathered for the festival.

Over 500 died.

645
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,880
It was a third of the town's population,

646
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
and now, nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

647
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,200
Teshigawara...

648

After all,
this girl here died three years ago!

653
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,420
Just... two or three weeks ago,
she said that I'd be able to see the comet.

654
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,670

659
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,970
Sounds lively over there.

660
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,970
They only have one room left.
I'm really sorry.

661
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,880
It's not a problem.

662
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,600
How's Taki?

663
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,210
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

664
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,890
He's goin' through all those newspapers
and magazines at random. Seems obsessive.

665
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,380
- What is it?
- Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

666
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,070
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

667
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,100
What do you think about
what Taki's been saying?

668
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,550
I had feelings for him, y'know.

669
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,780
The way he's been recently.

670
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,750
I mean, he was a nice guy
before, but he's even nicer now.

671
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,770
Kind-of... frantic.

672
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,800
It was cute.

673
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,480
Although, I do think what he's been
telling us is definitely strange-sounding.

674
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:15,440
But in the end, the fact remains that Taki's met
someone, and that someone is the reason he changed.

675
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,700
That much is for sure.

It was all just a dream.

00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,590
I recognized the landscape

679

because I unconsciously remembered
the news from three years ago.

If it's not that, is she... a ghost?

Or...

682
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,780
did I just make it up?

778
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:37,340
Mitsuha! Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

779
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,010
[Gasp]

780
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,350
Taki (as Mitsuha): Mitsuha.

781
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,980
She's alive!

782
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:04,330
[Sobbing]

783
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,580
Let me guess, you're touching your boo-

784
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,670
[Gasp]

785
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,770
[Crying] Her sister!

786
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,330
Yotsuha!

787
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,350
Yotsuha: Ungh!

788
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,670
[Shudder]

789
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,170
I think she's finally lost it.

790
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:27,540
Just for today,
I-I'm gonna head out first...

791
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,860
She's lost it...

792
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,070
Really lost it...

793
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,410
Totally!

794
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,660
Totally...

795
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:38,410
-For all you stargazers out there, the comet Tiamat
has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

796
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:44,770
Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 PM (19:40),
and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's...

797
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,730
It's tonight! There's still time left!

798
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,220
Mornin', Mitsuha!

799
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,510
What's this?

800
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,850
Hold on...

801
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,690
- You're not Mitsuha, are you?
- W-wait, how did you-?

802
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,170
You already knew?

803
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:07,200
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

804
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,890
When I was a young girl,

805
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:13,010
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

806
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,810
Huh?

807
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:20,710
Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became
in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

808
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,940
Faded?

809
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,230
Treasure the experience.
Dreams eventually will fade away.

810
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:30,050
I went through similar times myself,

811
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,700
and so did your mother.

812
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,310
What if...

813
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,960
all those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had!

814
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,300
It had to do with today!

815
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,720
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

816
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,490
Tonight,

817
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,800
the comet is going to fall on Itomori!

818
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,190
- You're all gonna die!
- Huh?

819
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,390
"Nobody's gonna believe that?"

820
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:00,340
I didn't expect that out
of Mitsuha's grandma.

821
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,270
It doesn't matter!
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

822
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,280
Mitsuha!

823
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,820
What happened... to-?

824
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,550
What'd you-?

825
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,520
Your hair!

826
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,000
-Ugh, the haircut?
Looked better before, huh?
-No, i-i-it's good!

827
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,690
Nevermind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

828
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,400
It's up to us to save everyone!

829
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,410
Wait, shouldn't you be in school?

830
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:36,120
Well, we sort-of have to save the
town, or something.

831
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Heh?

832
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,380
- The warning system?
- Yeah, those speakers all over the town.

833
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,890
"Superimposition, frequency"

834
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,280
I get it. It could work!

835
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,540
- Niiiice job, Teshi.
- Hey, I don't think you should
be sittin' so close to me.

836
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:56,150
- What's wrong. Uh-oh! You shyyy?
- Would you quit it?!

837
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,400
It ain't proper and you know it!

838
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,880
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

839
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,830
Taki (as Mitsuha): T-hahahahaha!

840
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,130
Such a gentleman.

841
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,000
I bought all the snacks, guys.

842
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,470
- Here's the change.
- Sorry for the trouble.

843
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,470
I didn't mind.

844
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,660
- We oughta be gettin' paid.
- Quit complaining.

845
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,670
So? Wha'dcha come up with?

846
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,080
Got an evacuation plan?

847
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:24,610
A- A-

848
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,020
A BOMB?!

849
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,370
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

850
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,010
AND the warning system?

851
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,150
Our startup frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily,

852
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:41,340
so we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

853
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,690
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

854
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,460
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

855
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,770
It's-

856
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,970
- It's totally a crime!
- You'll be in charge
of the broadcast, Saya.

857
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,460
- Why me?!
- You're in the Broadcast Club.

858
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,250
- And I'll be in charge of the explosives.
- While I go have a word with the mayor.

859
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,140
- Why?
- 'Cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from Town Hall, then nobody's gonna go anyway.

860
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,470
But if I talk to the mayor,
as his daughter, I can convince him.

861
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,120
It's the perfect plan!

862
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,300
Fine, I don't really care
one way or the other.

863
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,190
This is just a theory of yours, right?

864
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,810
Well...

865
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:21,590
Theories can be based on reality. Like, do you know the
story of how Itomori Lake was formed? It's a crater!

866
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,750
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

867
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:28,090
- That means a meteor hit this area
at least once a thousand years ago!
- Right. That's why-!

868
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:29,890
Nice one, Teshi!

869
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,520
- Let's go evacuate the town!
- Let's go evacuate the town!

870
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,710
Mitsuha's Father: What on earth
are you talking about?!

871
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,040
Like I said,

872
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,000
-We have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or else-
-Enough! Shut up!

873
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:58,470
"The comet's going to split
in two and strike the town?"

874
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,010
"Itomori Town Hall"

875
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:01,140
"Over 500 will die?"

876
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,620
How dare you stand there
and spout such nonsense!

877
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:08,030
If you're serious, you must be sick!

878
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:12,000
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

879
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:16,450
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

880
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:20,380
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

881
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,880
You!

882
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:28,010
You son of a- !

883
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,000
Mitsuha's Father: Mitsuha...

884
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,390
No...

885
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,410
Wait a minute...

886
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,590
Who are you?

887
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,950
-I'll see you guys at the festival, ba-bye!
-We'll meet ya at the step stone shrine.
Don't be late, k?

888
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,910
- Ba-bye!
- Seeya!
- Later!

889
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,710
You shouldn't go!

890
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:11,880
-You've got to leave town!
Tell all of your friends!
-What's wrong with you?!

891
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,300
- Mitsuha!
- What was that about?
- Come on, let's go.

892
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,700
What are you doing, huh?

893
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,030
If it was Mitsuha,

894
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,320
would she have been able to convince him?

895
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,190
- Is all this my fault?!
- Huh?!

896
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:27,930
Yotsuha, promise me that you'll
leave town with grandma before dark!

897
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:28,570
What?!

898
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,670
- You're gonna die if you stay here!
- What are you talking about?!

899
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:37,530
And why did you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?!
You've been acting really strange lately!

900
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,750
- Went to Tokyo?
- Hey! Mitsuha!

901
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,960
How'd it go with your old man?

902
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:51,250
Hey, Mitsuha!

903
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,900
What's with your sister?

904
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,280
Don't know.

905
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,510
[Ding]

906
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,410
Could she be over there?

907
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,890
What's that? What's over there?

908
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:12,030
- Let me use your bike, Teshi.
- Hey.

909
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,040
Mitsuha.

910
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,060
And what do we do?

911
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,200
Get things ready like we planned!

912
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,930
I'm counting on you!

913
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,010
Mitsuha: Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again!

914
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,630
What's Taki doin' out here?

915
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,480
The town!

916
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,370
It's gone!

917
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:18,000
So...

918
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,000
does that mean...

919
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,910
I... died?!

920
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,710
"Taki."

921
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:39,020
"Taki!"

922
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,800
"Don't you remember?!"

923
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,550
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

924
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,370
Wha? Right now?

925
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,800
- But why?
- Uh...

926
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,210
For a date.

927
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,320
- You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!
- I-I didn't say it was a date for me.

928
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,000
"I'll be back tonight."

929
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,000
Mitsuha: If I suddenly show up, will it
be a nuisance or a surprise?

930
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
He might not like it if I do.

931
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,370
"The number you are trying to reach
is currently outside the cellular network."

932
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,620
I guess it won't happen, but...

933

What if it did?

01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,590
What would I do?

935
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,640

01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:07,250
- You can do it!
- Aw, nuts! It's do or die!

1100
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,280
- Shouldn't it be goin' off?
- Hell if I know!

1101
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:26,850
- Oooh...
- Ha ha!

1102
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,020
- What was that?
- It was pretty loud, too.

1103
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,960
Look over there!

1104
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:58,990
- Hey look, up there!
- Whoa!

1105
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:10,050
This is Itomori Town Hall!

1106
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:15,000
- Reports of an explosion at
the substation are coming in!
- An explosion? Did I hear that right?

1107
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,560
Wildfires are possible,
as well as the threat of more explosions!

1108
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:25,840
Residents in the followin' areas, please
evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.

1109
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,550
Kadoiri District.

1110
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:31,160
- Sakagami District!
- Honey, we should go.

1111
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,610
The broadcast isn't coming from us?
Well, who the hell is it, then?

1112
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,730
Miyamori District.

1113
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,910
Oyazawa District.

1114
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,180
Let's go, Mitsuha!

1115
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,010
Teshi!

1116
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:56,590
- Everyone, run! There's a wildfire!
- Wildfire, please run!

1117
01:25:56,590 --> 01:26:01,440
- Get outta here! Run, there's a fire!
- It's not safe here! Please, evacuate!

1118
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:04,090
It's not workin',
we're runnin' out of time!

1119
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:06,600
- Mitsuha!
- [Sobbing]

1120
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,000
What's wrong?

1121
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,570
What is it...?

1122
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,980
I can't remember what his name is anymore!

1123
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,160
What is with you?!
You're the one who started all of this!

1124
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,640
We can't evacuate everyone
without firefighters!

1125
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,900
Get goin'! You gotta convince your old man!

1126
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:37,100
Everybody, get to the high school! HURRY!

1127
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,990
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

1128
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,700
-Why would terrorists attack way out here?
What is Chubu Electric saying?
-They're still checking.

1129
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,210
Any update? No wildfires yet?

1130
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,300
You sure? Got it.

1131
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:58,440
Make them stop this broadcast immediately!
Haven't you located its source yet?

1132
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,390
Mayor, the Takayama sensor
station just called!

1133
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,040
From the high school?

1134
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:09,780
Once again, residents in the following
areas, please evacuate to Itomori High...

1135
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,660
- Ah!
- What are you doing?! Turn that off!

1136
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,600
- They got Saya!
- Oh no.

1137
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,780
What were you thinking, Natori?! I swear!

1138
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:30,780
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1139
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:35,310
We are currently confirming
the reports of the accident.

1140
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:42,180
- We instruct all residents to remain calm and stay where they are until further notice.
- I guess... we have to stay put?

1141
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,700
- What is goin' on?
- So stay on standby.

1142
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,360
Come on! They said everyone should evacuate!
The high school's the evacuation center!

1143
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,500
-Katsuhiko!

1144
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,740
Tell me...

1145
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:58,510
What do you think you're doing?!

1146
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,490
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1147
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,440
This is the end.

1148
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,020
[Gasp]

1149
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,520
Oh, my God!

1150
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,330
It's actually splittin' apart!

1151
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:23,890
Look at that! The comet has split into two large
parts and meteors are now falling to Earth!

1152
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,380
- Uh, I don't believe anyone
could have predicted this.
- Either way, we have
quite the mystical view here.

1153
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,870
-So, what does the comet's
nucleus splitting mean for us?

1154
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:37,690
-The comet's not within the Roche limit, so the nucleus
itself must've had a structural weakness for this to happen.

1155
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:42,520
-Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1156
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,220
- There were at least 21 fragments...
- I'm going outside to take a look.

1157
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:48,650
- The fragments will likely burn up
well before reaching the ground.
- Does it pose a danger?

1158
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:53,020
-Probability of a meteor actually landing
on a populated area is quite small.

1159
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,650
-never foresaw this development.

1160
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:58,770
- To predict the trajectory...
- As we stand here witnessing
this spectacle,

1161
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,270
unassisted...

1162
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,590
and with our bare eyes,

1163
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:06,970
it strikes me that living in such an age
has never felt more fortunate than now.

1164
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,700
Mitsuha: Hey...

1165
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:12,310
Who...

1166
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,000
are you?

1167
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,200
Who?

1168
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,240
Who?

1169
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:22,260
Who is he?

1170
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:24,030
Someone precious.

1171
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,020
Someone I shouldn't forget!

1172
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:28,740
Someone I didn't want to!

1173
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,430
Who?

1174
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:31,510
Who?!

1175
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:33,410
Who are you?!

1176
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:36,150
What's your name?!

1177
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,460
Oh no!

1178
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,880
Ah! Argh!

1179
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:48,780
Ungh!

1180
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,410
-"So that we don't forget
things when we wake up..."

"Let's write down our names."

"I love you"

1183
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,160
Writing this...

1184
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,790
doesn't help!

1185
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,090
I won't know your name...

1186
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,130
[Crying]

1187
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,280
Dad!

- Mitsuha.
- There you are!

1189
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,110
Don't tell me you're back!

1190
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:01,000
Ah...

1191
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,090
-"It was almost like seeing
something out of a dream."

"Nothing more or less..."

1193
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,700
"than a breathtaking view."

1194
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:15,110
Words like "tomorrow"
or "future" or "fate",

1195
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:18,910
no matter how far they extend their hands,

1196
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:22,720
we breathe, we dream, we raise our love

1197
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,860
in a timeless land
that is far out of reach.

1198
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:30,530
Even the second, hour hands of the clock.

1199
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:34,550
They look at us sideways
as they tick and tock.

1200
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:39,410
How I hope to have
forever to spend this life,

1201
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,830
no- all future lives

1202
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:49,630
right here in this world with you!

1203
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,850
Taki: Huh?

1204
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:45,880
Why am I here?

1205
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,980
What am I... doing?

[Gasp]

01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:09,680
U-uh!

Train Announcer: "The doors are closing.
Please be careful."

1209
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,400
Taki: I'm always searching for something.

1210
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,030
This... feeling has consumed me...

1211
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,990
for some time.

1212
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:32,350
The reason I applied for this position-

1213
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,890
The landscapes people live in-

1214
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,840
To build a city's landscape-

1215
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,800
Even Tokyo. It might vanish too one day.

1216
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,210
And so, I wanna make landscapes
that- how should I put this?

1217
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:46,700
That can continue to warm peoples' hearts.

1218

[Sigh]

01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,400
Taki: I've stopped counting.
Tsukasa: Doesn't sound too promising.

1221
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,990
- Who asked you?
- That suit could be the problem.

1222
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:57,760
-It looks just like yours!

1223
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,170
- Well, I have two offers.
- I have eight myself.

1226
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,880
someone?

1227
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,370
Or somewhere?

1228
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:15,390
Or am I just searching
for the right job?

1229
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,320
I don't even really know.

1230
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:19,220
Oh!

1231
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:23,100
- You're job hunting, huh?
- I haven't had much luck, though.

1232
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:27,950
- Hey, maybe it's the suit
that's killing your chances.
- Uh-does it really look that bad on me?

1233
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,850
-So, why the sudden call today?

1234
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:40,010
-I was in the area for work and I figured
it had been a while since I saw your face.

"8 years since the comet disaster"

Okudera: Remember that one time when we
went all the way to Itomori?

1237
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:49,350
You were still in high school back
then, so it was...

1238
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,580
- Heh. Five years ago.
- That long?

1239
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,530
It seems like...

1240
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,130
I've forgotten a lot.

1241
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:59,950
Taki: I don't... remember all that much,
either.

1242
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,700
About back then.

1243
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:04,200
Maybe we argued.

1244
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,460
She and Tsukasa went
back to Tokyo without me.

1245
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:11,010
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1246
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,980
That's about all I remember.

1247
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:23,330
But, at one point in time, I found myself strangely
drawn to the incident involving that comet.

1248
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,000
A fragment of the comet destroyed
a town in that disaster,

1249
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:33,470
"Evacuation of residents to
high school grounds confirmed."

1250
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,000
but, miraculously,

1251
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,210
most of the people living
in the town were unhurt.

1252
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:38,010
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

1253
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,260
"No deaths, 104 wounded"

1255
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:41,380

were outside the impact zone.

1258
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:47,600
The sheer luck and coincidence of it
all sparked various conspiracy theories.

"Mysterious explosion at the substation"

1262
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:52,990
I was kind-of obsessed.

01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:59,000
But whatever the reason I had for my
interest... is a mystery to me now.

1264
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:03,000
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1265
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:09,100
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1266
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,080
I do hope,

1267
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,980
that at some point,

1268
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:16,980
you'll find happiness, too.

I feel like I'm always searching.

1270
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:24,430

- Oh, that reminds me, Teshi!
- Uh!

01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:53,380
Would ya please shave before the ceremony?
I'm goin' on a diet for it, you know.

-someone!

1304
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:31,630
Oh yes, we are time fliers,

1305
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:34,500
scaling the walls of time. Climber

1306
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:39,210
tired of playing
hide-and-seek with time and

1307
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:41,330
always comin' dead short.

01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:43,140
I'll never let you go now,

1309
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,630
promise I will never let you go now,

1310
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:48,340
'cause my hand finally has reached yours!

1311
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,010
Why should I have to?

1312
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,590
Oh, you're sure quite a showy crier.

1313
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,950
Wanna stop your tears,

1314
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,440
see your eyes drier.

1315
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,660
But when I went to wipe your tears dry,

1316
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:04,200
you refused, but I saw them
pouring down your face, I knew why.

1317
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,900
Crying even when you're happy,

1318
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,530
smiling even when you're feeling lonely.

1319
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:10,490
It's because a part of you

1320
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:13,410
has made it here before the rest has.

1321

Haven't we...?

01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,250
Have I...

1324
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,970
met you somewhere?

1325
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,690
Mitsuha: I thought so, too!

1326
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:49,230
- Can I ask you...
- Can I ask you...

1327
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,680
- your name?
- your name?

1328
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:57,180
The sorrowful gust of wind that
blew right between you and me,

1329
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:02,920
where did it find the loneliness
it carried on the breeze?

1330
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:08,680
Looking up at the sky after
shedding a stream of tears,

1331
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:14,290
I could see for miles of blue,
it's never been so clear.

1332
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:31,430
Speeches that my father gave me
would always make me despair.

1333
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:37,050
Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today.

1334
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:42,830
Your ever kind heart, the way you smile,
and even how you find your dreams.

1335
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:48,330
I knew nothing, so honestly,
I've always copied you.

1336
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:50,810
Now, just a little more,

1337
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:54,070
only just a little more.

1338

Let's stay here a little longer now.

1339
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,310
Now just a little more,

1340
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:05,510
only just a little more.

1341
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:10,100
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

1342
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,510
Oh yes, we are time fliers

1343
01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:19,390
scaling the walls of time. Climber

1344
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:24,080
tired of playing hide-and-seek
with time and

1345
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,180
always comin' dead short.

1346
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,870
Crying even when you're happy,

1347
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:30,500
smiling even when you're feeling lonely.

1348
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:35,240
It's because a part of you has
made it here before the rest has.

1349
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:02,830
I used to wish upon the stars,
the toys that I once adored.

1350
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:08,780
Forgotten now, are rollin'
'round the corners of the floor.

1351
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:14,390
Finally, my dream has counted
up to a hundred today.

1352
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:20,210
Someday, I'll trade them
all for just the very one.

1353
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:31,650
Girl that I have seen in school,
that never have told "hello",

1354
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:37,270
After class today, I waved and
said, “See you tomorrow!”

1355
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:42,920
It's not really that bad trying
something new every once in a while,

1356
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:48,420
especially if I can do
it with you by my side.

1357
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,950
Now just a little more,

1358
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:54,140
only just a little more.

1359
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:59,020
Let's stay here a little longer now.

1360
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,390
Just a little more,

1361
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:05,610
only just a little more.

1362
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:10,000
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

1363
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:17,750
Oh yes, we are time fliers, so, and I...

1364
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,630
I knew who you were way before...

1365
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,790
way before I even knew my own name.

1366
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:30,270
There's no clue, but I'm sure. I swear!

1367
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:34,910
Even if you're not around
in this wide world,

1368
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:37,740
of course it surely would
have some kind of meaning.

1369
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:40,650
But if when you're not
around in this crazy world,

1370
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,710
would be like the month of
August without summer break.

1371
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:46,360
And if you're not around
in this great world,

1372
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,610
would be like Santa Claus without any glee.

1373
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:57,620
If you're not around in this wide world!

1374
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:25,190
Oh yes, we are time fliers

1375
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:28,130
scaling the walls of time. Climber

always comin' dead short.

1378
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,690
No, never mind that!

1379
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,250
No, never mind what I said now,

1380
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,300
'cause I'm on my way to you!

1381
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,070
Oh, we are time fliers,

1382
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:48,920
dashing up the steps of time now!

1383
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,590
No more playing hide-and-seek
with you and time

1384
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:55,670
and always comin' dead short!

1385
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:57,500
You're quite a showy crier!

1386
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,850

1391
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,440
smiling even when I'm feeling lonely!

1392
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,430
It's because the heart of mine

1393
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:17,170
has made it here before my body.
